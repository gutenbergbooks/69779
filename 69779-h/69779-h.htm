<div><h1 id='ch1'>1.<br> <span class='sub-head'>How the Tempter Came</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>F</span></span>OR some moments after he had materialized,
and had become perceivable by human senses,
the Sylan waited. He waited, looking down
at the very busy, young, red-haired fellow who sat
within arm’s reach at the writing-table. This boy, as
yet, was so unhappily engrossed in literary composition
as not to have noticed his ghostly visitant. So the
Sylan waited....</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as always, to an onlooker, the motions of creative
writing revealed that flavor of the grotesque
which is attendant upon every form of procreation.
The Sylan rather uneasily noted the boy’s writhing
antics, which to a phantom seemed strange and eerie....
For this mortal world, as the Sylan well remembered,
was remarkably opulent in things which gave
pleasure when they were tasted or handled,—the
world in which this pensive boy was handling, and
now nibbled at, the tip-end of a black pen. Outside
this somewhat stuffy room were stars or sunsets or
impressive mountains, to be looked at from almost
anywhere in this mortal world,—which would also
afford to the investigative, who searched in appropriate
places, such agreeable smells as that of vervain
and patchouli, and of smouldering incense, and of
hayfields under a large moon, and of pine woods, and
the robustious salty odors of a wind coming up from
the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Likewise, at this very moment, you might encounter,
in the prodigal world outside this somewhat
stuffy room, those tinier, those mere baby winds
which were continually whispering in the tree-tops
about this world’s marvelousness now that April was
departing; or you might hear the irrationally dear
sound of a bird calling dubiously in the spring night,
with a very piercing sweetness; or, if you went adventuring
yet farther, you might hear the muffled delicious
voice of a woman counterfeiting embarrassment
and reproof of your enterprise.... Outside
this book-filled room, in fine, was that unforgotten
mortal world in which any conceivable young man
could live very royally, and with never-failing ardor,
upon every person’s patrimony of the five human
senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, in such a well-stocked world, this lean,
red-headed boy was vexedly making upon paper
(with that much nibbled-at black pen) small
scratches, the most of which he almost immediately
canceled with yet other scratches, all the while with
the air of a person who is about something intelligent
and of actual importance. This Gerald Musgrave
therefore seemed to the waiting, spectral Sylan a
somewhat excessively silly mortal, thus to be squandering
a lad’s brief while of living in vigorous young
human flesh, among so many readily accessible objects
which a boy like this could always be seeing and
tasting and smelling and hearing and handling, with
unforgotten delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Sylan reflected, too, a bit wistfully, that
his own mortal youth was now for some time overpast.
It had, in fact, been nearly six hundred years
since he had been really young, a good five and a
half centuries since young Guivric and his nine tall
comrades in the famous fellowship had so delighted
in their patrimony of five human senses and had
spent that inheritance rather notably. Yes, he was
getting on, the Sylan reflected; he had quite lost
touch with the ways of these latter-day young people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was perhaps unavoidable that in the great
while since he had gone about this world in a man’s
natural body, the foibles of human youth had become
somewhat strange to him; and it was not, after
all, to appraise the wastefulness of authors that you
had traveled a long way, from Caer Omn to Lichfield,
at the command of another Author, to put this
doomed red-headed boy out of living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sylan spoke....</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>2.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Evelyn of Lichfield</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE Sylan spoke. He spoke at some length.
And the young man at the writing-table,
after arising with the slight start which these
supernatural visitations invariably evoked from him,
had presently heard the Sylan’s proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it,” said Gerald, then, “that tempts me
to this sacrifice and to this partial destruction?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sylan replied, “The name that I had in my
mortal living was Guivric, but now I am called
Glaum of the Haunting Eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a queer name, and it was a queer arrangement,
too, which this vague wraith in the likeness
of a man was proposing,—an arrangement,
Gerald Musgrave decided, which, at least, was
worth consideration....</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, as a student of magic, Gerald Musgrave in
his time had dealt with many demons: but never had
been made to him, before this final night in the April
of 1805, such a queer, and yet rational, and even
handsome offer as was now held out. Gerald pushed
aside the manuscript of his unfinished romance about
Dom Manuel of Poictesme; he straightened the
ruffles about his throat; and for an instant he
weighed the really quite alluring suggestion....
Most demons were obsessed by the notion of buying
from you a soul which Gerald, in this age of reason,
had no sure proof that he possessed. But this Glaum
of the Haunting Eyes, it seemed, was empowered
and willing to rid Gerald of all corporal obligations,
and to take over Gerald’s physical life
just as it stood,—even with all the plaguing complications
of Gerald’s entanglement with Evelyn
Townsend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was once human,” the Sylan explained, “and
wore a natural body. And old habits, in such trifles
as apparel, cling. I feel at times, even nowadays,
after five centuries of a Sylan’s care-free living,
rather at a loss for human ties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find them,” Gerald stated, “vast nuisances.
Candor is no more palatable than an oyster when
either is out of season. And my relatives are all
cursed with a very disastrous candor. They conceal
from me nothing save that respect and envy with
which they might, appropriately, regard my accomplishments
and nobler qualities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That has been the way with all relatives, Gerald,
since Cain and Abel were brothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, but for one calamity, I could, it might be,
endure my brothers. I could put up with my sisters’
voluble and despondent view of my future. I might
even go so far in supererogation as to condone—upon
alternate Thursdays, say,—a chorus of affectionate
aunts who speak for my own good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first person, Gerald, that pretended to
speak for the real good of anybody else was a serpent
in a Garden, and ever since then that sort of
talking has been venomous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet all these afflictions I might,” said Gerald,—“conceivably,
at least, I might be able to endure, if
only the pursuit of my art had not been hampered,
and the ease of my body blasted, by the greatest
blessing which can befall any man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You allude, I imagine,” said the Sylan, “to the
love of a good woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it, that is precisely the unmerited and too
irremovable blessing which may end, after all, in
reducing me to your suggested vulgar fraction of a
suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Gerald was silent. He leaned far back in his
chair. He meditatively placed together the tips of
his two little fingers, and then one by one the tips of
his other fingers, until his thumbs also were in contact;
and he regarded the result, upon the whole,
with disapprobation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every marriage gets at least one man into
trouble,” he philosophised, “and it is not always the
bridegroom. You see, sir, by the worst of luck, this
Evelyn Townsend was already married, so that ours
had necessarily to become an adulterous union. It
is the tragedy of my life that I met my Cousin Evelyn
too late to marry her. Any married person of real
ingenuity and tolerable patience can induce his wife
to divorce him. But there is no way known to me for
a Southern gentleman to get rid of a lady whom he
has possessed illegally, until she has displayed the
decency to become tired of him. And Evelyn, sir, in
this matter of continuing her immoral relations with
me has behaved badly, very badly indeed—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All women—” Glaum began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but let us not be epigrammatic and aphoristic
and generally flippant about a perverseness which
is pestering me beyond any reasonable endurance!
You know as well as I do that every pretty woman
ought, by and by, to remember what she owes to her
husband and to her marriage vows, and to act accordingly.
Repentance when suitably timed in a
liaison makes for everybody’s happiness. But some
women, sir, some women stay more affectionately
adhesive than an anaconda. They weep. They reply
to their helpless paramours’ every least attempt at
any rational statement, ‘And I trusted you! I gave
you all!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glaum nodded, not unsympathetically. “I also in
my time have heard that observation without any
active enjoyment. It is, I believe, unanswerable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald shuddered. “There is, for a Southern gentleman
at all events, no really satisfactory reply save
murder. And against that solution there is of course
a rather general prejudice. Therefore a woman of
this bleating sort exacts fidelity, she makes every nature
of unconscionable demand, and she pesters you
to the verge of lunacy, always upon the unanswerable
ground that her claim upon your gratitude, and upon
your instant obedience in everything, ought not to
exist. Oh, I assure you, my dear fellow, there is no
more sensible piece of friendly counsel existent than
is the Seventh Commandment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your aphorisms are more or less true, and your
predicament I can understand. Nevertheless—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Sylan hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You also understand us Musgraves perfectly!”
Gerald applauded. “For I perceive you are now
about to wheedle me forward in this business by
throwing obstacles in my way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was but going to point out the truism that,
nevertheless, it may be wiser to put up with your
Eve unresistingly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name,” emended Gerald, “is Evelyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the Sylan smiled. “Yes, to be sure!
Women do vary in their given names. It might be
wiser, then, I was about to say, for you to put up with
your Evelyn unresistingly, rather than for a student
of magic, with so little real practical experience as
yours, to go blundering about the doubtful road
which leads to Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir, I have the soul of an artist! Once”—and
Gerald pointed to his manuscript,—“once it
was the little art of letters. Then, through my
acquaintance with Gaston Bulmer, who is no doubt
known to you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sylan shook his spectral head, like smoke in a
veering wind. “I have not, I believe, that pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You astound me. I would have supposed the
name of Gaston Bulmer to be in all infernal circles
a household word, because the dear old rascal is an
adept, sir, of wide parts, of taste, and of sound judgment.
Then, too, since Mrs. Townsend is his daughter,
he has now for some while been my father-in-law
for all practical purposes—But, where was I? Ah,
yes! Through Gaston Bulmer, I repeat, I became
initiate into the greatest of all arts. Now I desire to
excel in that art. I note that I falter in the little art
of letters, that my prose is no longer superb and
breath-taking in its loveliness, because my heart is
not any longer really interested in writing, on account
of my heart’s ever-pricking desire to revive in
its full former glories the far nobler and—at all
events, in the United States of America,—the unjustly
neglected art of the magician. And from
whom else—just as you have suggested, my dear
fellow,—from whom else save the Master Philologist
can I get the great and best words of
magic? Do you but answer me that very simple
question!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From no one else, to be sure—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, now, you see for yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet the Master Philologist is nowadays a married
man, and is ruled in everything by his wife. And
this Queen Freydis has a mirror which must, they
say, be faced by those persons who venture into the
goal of all the gods of men—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That mirror, too,” said Gerald, airily, “I may
be needing. Mirrors are employed in many branches
of magic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glaum now was speaking with rather more of
graveness than there seemed any call for. And
Glaum said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For one, I would not meddle with that mirror.
Even in the land of Dersam, where a mirror is
sacred, we do not desire any dealings with the
Mirror of the Hidden Children and with those
strange reflections which are unclouded by either
good or evil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall face the Mirror of the Hidden Children,”
Gerald said, with his chin well up, “and
should I see any particular need for it, I shall fetch
that mirror also out of Antan. When a citizen of the
United States of America takes up the pursuit of an
art, sir, he does not shilly-shally about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my part,” the Sylan answered, “I wearied,
some centuries ago, of all magic: and I hanker,
rather, after the more material things of life. For
five hundred years and over, in my untroubled abode
at Caer Omn, in the land of Dersam, I have reigned
among the dreams of a god—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how did you come by these dreams?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They forsook him, Gerald, when his hour was
come to descend into Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That saying, sir, I cannot understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not necessary, Gerald, that you should.
Meanwhile, I admit, the life of a Sylan has no fret
in it, a Sylan has nothing to be afraid of: and there
is in me a mortal taint which cannot endure interminable
contentment any longer. You conceive, I
also was once a mortal man, with my deceivings and
my fears and my doubts to spice my troubled deference
to the ever-present folly of my fellows and
to the ever-present ruthlessness of time and chance.
And, as I remember it, Gerald, that Guivric, whom
people so preposterously called the Sage, got more
zest out of his subterfuges and compromises than I
derive from being care-free and rather bored twenty-four
hours to each insufferable day. Therefore, I repeat,
I will take over your natural body—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that, my dear fellow, would leave me without
any carnal residence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Gerald, but I am surprised at such scepticism
in you who pay your pew-rent so regularly! We
have it upon old, fine authority that for every man
there is a natural body and a spiritual body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald colored up. He felt that both his
erudition and his piety stood reproved. And he said,
contritely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact, as a member of the Protestant Episcopal
church, I am familiar with the Burial Service—Yes,
you are right. I have no desire to take issue with
St. Paul. The religion of my fathers assures me that
I have two bodies. I can live in only one of them at a
time. It is, for that matter, a bit ostentatious, it has a
vaguely disreputable sound, for any unmarried man
to be maintaining two establishments. So, let us get
on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore, I repeat, I will take over your natural
body, just as that first Glaum once took over
my body; and I will take over all your body’s imbroglios,
even with your mistress,—who can hardly
be more tasking to get along with than are the seven
official wives and the three hundred and fifty-odd
concubines I am getting rid of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You,” Gerald said, morosely, “do not know
Evelyn Townsend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust,” the Sylan stated, more gallantly, “to
have that privilege to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this way the bargain was struck. And
then the Sylan who was called Glaum of the Haunting
Eyes did what was requisite.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>3.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Two Geralds</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE Sylan who was called Glaum of the
Haunting Eyes, be it repeated, did that which
was requisite.... To Gerald, as a student
of magic, the most of the process was familiar
enough: and if some curious grace-notes were, perhaps,
excursions into the less wholesome art of goety,
that was not Gerald’s affair. It was sufficient that,
when the Sylan had ended, no Sylan was any longer
visible. Instead, in Gerald Musgrave’s library, stood
face to face two Geralds, each in a blue coat and
a golden yellow waistcoat, each with a tall white
stock and ruffles about his throat, and each clad in
every least respect precisely like the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did these two lean, red-headed Geralds differ
in countenance. Each smiled at the other with the
same amply curved, rather womanish mouth set
above the same prominent, long chin; and each found
just the same lazy and mildly humorous mockery in
the large and very dark blue, the really purple, eyes
of the other: for between these two Gerald Musgraves
there was no visual difference whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One half of this quaint pair now sat down at the
writing-table; and, fiddling with the papers there, he
took up the pages of Gerald Musgrave’s unfinished
romance, about the high loves of his famous ancestor
Dom Manuel of Poictesme and Madame Niafer,
the Soldan of Barbary’s daughter. Gerald had begun
this tale in the days when he had intended to endow
America with a literature superior to that of other
countries; but for months now he had neglected it:
and, in fact, ever since he set up as a student of magic
he had lacked time, somehow, with every available
moment given over to runes and cantraps and suffumigations,
to get back to any really serious work
upon this romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the seated Gerald, smiling almost sadly,
looked up toward his twin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus it was,” said the seated Gerald, “a great
while ago at Asch, when two Guivrics confronted
each other and played shrewdly for the control of
the natural body of Guivric of Perdigon. All which
I lost on that day, through my over-human clinging
to the Two Truths, I now have back, after five centuries
of pleasure-seeking in the land of Dersam.
And I find this second natural body of mine committed
to the creating of yet more pleasure-giving
nonsense, about, of all persons, that eternal Manuel
of Poictesme! I find this body also enamored of the
fig-leaf of romance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be that I do not understand your simile,”
said the standing Gerald, “for in the United States
of America the fig-leaf is, rather, the nice symbol of
decency, it is, indeed, the beginning and the end of
democratic morality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, and granting all this,” replied the
now demon-haunted natural body of Gerald Musgrave,
“the fig-leaf is a romance with which human
optimism veils the only two eternal and changeless
and rather unlovely realities of which any science can
be certain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now I comprehend! And without utterly
agreeing with you, I cannot deny there is something
in your metaphor. Yet I must tell you, sir, that I am
perhaps peculiarly qualified to deal with Dom Manuel
because of the fact that this famous hero was
my lineal ancestor—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but, my poor Gerald, was he indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, through both the Musgrave and the Allonby
lines. For my mother’s father was Gerald Allonby—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald would have gone on to explain the
precise connection, of which the Musgrave family
was justifiably proud. But the unappreciative Sylan
who now wore good Musgrave flesh and blood had
remarked, of all conceivable remarks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I honestly condole with you. Yet ancestors cannot
be picked like strawberries. And my luck was
even worse, for I was of Manuel’s fellowship. I
knew the tall swaggerer himself throughout his blundering
career. And I can assure you that, apart from
his unhuman gift for keeping his mouth shut, there
was nothing a bit wonderful about the cock-eyed,
gray impostor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was surprising news. Still, Gerald reflected,
a demon did, in the way of business, meet many persons
in circumstances in which the better side of their
natures was not to the fore. Gerald therefore flew
to defend the honor of his race quite civilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My progenitor, in any event, carried through his
imposture. He died very well thought of by his neighbors.
That you will find to be a leading consideration
with any citizen of the United States of America.
And I in turn assure you that my account of the great
Manuel’s exploits will be, when it is completed, an
exceedingly fine romance. It will be a tale which has
not its like in America. Loveliness lies swooning
upon every page, illuminated by a never-ceasing coruscation
of wit. It is a story which, as you might put
it, grips the reader. There is no imaginable reader
but will be instantly engaged, by my adroit depiction
of the hardihood and the heroic virtues of Dom
Manuel—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said the really very handsomely disguised
Sylan, “Manuel had always a cold in his head. Nobody
can honestly admire an elderly fellow who is
continually sneezing and spitting—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In American literature of a respectable cast no
human being has any excretory functions. Should
you reflect upon this statement, you will find it to be
the one true test of delicacy. At most, some tears or
a bead or two of perspiration may emanate, but not
anything more, upon this side of pornography. That
rule applies with especial force to love stories, for
reasons we need hardly go into. And my romance is,
of course, the story of Dom Manuel’s love for the
beautiful Niafer, the Soldan of Barbary’s daughter—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father was a stable groom. She had a game
leg. She was not beautiful. She was dish-faced, she
was out and out ugly, apart from her itch to be reforming
everybody and pestering them with respectability—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith, charity and hope are the three cardinal
virtues,” said Gerald, reprovingly. “And I think
that a gentleman should exercise these three, in just
this order, when he is handling the paternity or the
looks or the legs of any lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And she smelt bad. Every month she seemed
to me to smell worse. I do not know why, but I think
the Countess simply hated to wash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow! really now, I can but refer you
to my previously cited rule as to the anatomy of romance.
A heroine who smells bad every month—No,
upon my word, I can find nothing engaging in that
notion. I had far rather play with some wholly other
and more beautiful idea than with a notion so utterly
lacking in seductiveness. For this, I repeat, is a romance.
It is a romance such as has not its like in
America. I therefore consider that I display considerable
generosity in presenting you with those
quite perfect ninety-three pages, and in permitting
you to complete this romance and to take the credit
for writing all of it. Why, your picture will be in the
newspapers, and learned professors will annotate
your fornications, and oncoming ages will become familiar
with every mean act you ever committed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To that the Sylan replied: “I shall complete your
balderdash, no doubt, since all your functions are
now my functions. I shall complete it, if only my common-sense
and my five centuries of living among the
loveliest dreams of a god, and, above all, if my first-hand
information as to these people, have not ruined
me for the task of ascribing large virtues to human
beings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I envy you that task,” said Gerald, with real
wistfulness, “but, very much as there was a geas
upon my famous ancestor to make a figure in this
world, just so there is a compulsion upon me. The
compulsion is upon me to excel in my art; and to do
this I must liberate the great and best words of the
Master Philologist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the true Gerald went out of the room
through a secret passage unknown to him until this
evening.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>4.<br> <span class='sub-head'>That Devil in the Library</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>Y</span></span>ET Gerald looked back for an instant at that
unfortunate devil, in the appearance of a sedate
young red-haired man, who remained in
the library. To regard this Gerald Musgrave, now,
was like looking at a droll acquaintance in whom
Gerald was not, after all, very deeply interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this Gerald Musgrave, the one who remained
in the library, was really droll in well-nigh every respect.
About the Gerald who was now—it might
be, a bit nobly,—yielding up his life in preference
to violating the code of a gentleman, and who was
now quitting Lichfield, in order to become a competent
magician, there was not anything ludicrous.
That Gerald was an honorable and intelligent person
who sought a high and rational goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that part of Gerald Musgrave which remained
behind, that part which was already marshaling more
words in order the more pompously to inter the exploits
of Dom Manuel of Poictesme, appeared droll.
There was, for one thing, no sensible compulsion
upon that red-haired young fellow thus to be defiling
clean paper with oak-gall, when he might at that
very instant be comfortably drunk at the Vartreys’
dinner, or he might be getting pleasurable excitement
out of the turns of fortune at Dorn’s gaming-parlors,
or he might be diverting himself in his choice of four
bedrooms with a lively companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, instead, he sat alone with bookshelves rising
stuffily to every side of him,—rather low bookshelves
upon the tops of which were perched a cherished
horde of porcelain and brass figures representing
one or another beast or fowl or reptile. Among
the shiny toys, which in themselves attested his
childishness, the young fellow sat of his own accord
thus lonely. And his antics, incontestably,
were queer. He fidgeted. He shifted his rump. He
hunched downward, as if with a sudden access of
rage, over the paper before him. He put back his
head, to stare intently at a white china hen. He
pulled at the lobe of his left ear; and he then rather
frantically scratched the interior of this ear with his
little finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between these bodily exercises he, who was so
precariously seated upon the crust of a planet teetering
unpredictably through space, was making upon
the paper before him, with his much nibbled-at black
pen, small scratches, the most of which he presently
canceled with yet other scratches, all the while with
the air of a person who was about something intelligent
and of actual importance. The spectacle was
queer; it was unspeakably irrational: for, as always,
to an onlooker, the motions of creative writing revealed
that flavor of the grotesque which is attendant
upon every form of procreation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it was upon a graver count that Gerald felt
honestly sorry for the inheritor of Gerald Musgrave’s
natural body. For Gerald was giving up his
life out of deference to the code of a gentleman with
rather more of relief than he had permitted the
Sylan to suspect. And the poor devil who had so
rashly taken over this life would—howsoever acute
his diabolical intelligence,—he too would, in the
end, Gerald reflected, be powerless against that unreasonable
Evelyn Townsend and that even more
unreasonable code of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody, Gerald’s thoughts ran on, now that he
had found a rather beautiful idea to play with, nobody
who had not actually indulged in the really
dangerous dalliance of adultery in Lichfield could
quite understand the hopelessness of the unfortunate
fiend’s position. For in the chivalrous Lichfield of
1805 adultery had its inescapable etiquette. Your
exact relations with the woman were in the small
town a matter of public knowledge familiar to everybody:
but no person in Lichfield would ever formally
grant that any such relations existed. Eyes might
meet with perfect understanding: but from the well-bred
lips of no Southern gentleman or gentlewoman
would ever come more than a suave and placid
“Evelyn and Gerald have always been such good
friends.” For you were second cousins, to begin with:
and—in a Lichfield wherein, as everywhere else in
this human world, most people unaffectedly disliked,
and belittled, and kept away from their cousins,—that
relationship was considered a natural reason for
you two being much together. Moreover, every
woman in Lichfield was, by another really rather
staggering social convention, assumed to be beautiful
and accomplished and chaste: it was an assumption
which needed hardly to be stated: it was merely
among all Southern gentry an axiom in the vast code
of being well-bred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It followed that, when you were once involved in
a liaison, your one salvation was for your co-partner
in iniquity to become tired of you, and to cease dwelling
upon the fact that she had trusted you and had
given you all. That remained, of course, by the dictates
of Southern chivalry, at any moment her privilege:
but in this case the inconsiderate woman only
grew fonder and fonder of Gerald, and repeated
the dreadful observation more and more frequently....
And it remained, too, the privilege of the technically
aggrieved husband to pick a quarrel with you,
provided only that the grounds of this quarrel in no
way involved a mention of his wife’s name. Then,
still by the set rules of Lichfield’s etiquette, there
would be a duel. After the duel you either were dispiritingly
dead or, else, if you happened to be the
more assuredly luckless survivor, you were compelled,
merely by the silent force of everybody’s assumption
that a gentleman could not do otherwise, to
marry the widow. To do this was your debt to society
at large, in atonement for having “compromised”
a lady, where, bewilderingly enough, she was
unanimously granted never to have been concerned
at all. For never, in either outcome, would the occurrence
of anything “wrong” be conceded, nor
would ever the possibility of a lady’s having committed
adultery be so much as hinted at in any speech
or act of the chivalrous gentry of Lichfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile you were trapped. There was no way
whatever of avoiding that bleated “Oh, and I trusted
you! I gave you all!” You were not even privileged
to avoid the woman. It was not considered humanly
possible that you were bored, and upon some occasions
frenziedly annoyed, by the society of a beautiful
and accomplished and chaste gentlewoman who
honored you with her friendship. There was, instead,
compressing you everywhere, the tacit but vast force
of the general assumption that your indebtedness to
her could not ever be discharged in full. The deplorable—and
sometimes, too, the rather dear—fond
woman’s inability to keep her hands off you was
conscientiously not noticed. So your Cousin Evelyn
pawed at you in public without an eyebrow’s going
up: hostesses smilingly put you together: other men
affably quitted her side whensoever you appeared.
Her husband was no different: Frank Townsend,
also, genially accepted—in the teeth of whatsoever
rationality the man might privately harbor,—the
axiom that “Evelyn and Gerald have always been
such good friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Gerald granted, this was, in the upper
circles of the best Southern families, an exceptional
case. Time and again Gerald had envied the dozens
of other young fellows in Lichfield who were conducting
their liaisons with visibly such superior luck.
For the lady tired of them or, else, was smitten with
convenient repentance: and these gay blades passed
on high-heartedly to the embraces of yet other technically
beautiful and accomplished and chaste playfellows.
But Evelyn evinced an impenitence which
threatened to be permanent; Evelyn did not tire of
Gerald; she pawed at him; she slipped notes into his
hand; she bleated almost every day her insufferable
claim to upset his convenience and his comfort: and
he cursed in all earnestness that fatal charm of his
which held him in such desperate loneliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>—In loneliness, because not even the lean comfort
of candor, not even any quest of sympathy, was
permitted you. A gentleman did not kiss and tell:
he, above all, might not tell that the kissing had become
an infernal nuisance. Not any of your brothers,
neither one of your sisters—not even when your
indolence and your general worthlessness had reduced
Cynthia to whimpering bits of the New Testament,
or had launched Agatha in a chattering millrace
of babbling maledictory vaticinations,—would
ever recognize to you in plain words that you and
Cousin Evelyn were illicitly intimate. Nor would any
of your kindred, either, ever contemplate the possibility
of you yourself acting or speaking here with
common-sense, or in any other manner violating the
formulas set for every gentleman’s conduct by the
insane and magnificent code of Lichfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it was, after all, magnificent, in its own way,
the code by which those bull-headed Musgraves—who
shared the blood that was in your body, but no
one of the notions in your astonishingly clever head,—along
with the rest of this brave and stupid Lichfield,
lived day after day, and carried genial, never-troubled
self-respect into the graveyard. This code
avoided, so far as Gerald could see, no especial misdoing
or crime: but it did show you how, with the
appropriate and most graceful of gestures, to commit
either, when the need arose, in the prescribed fashion
of a well-bred Southern gentleman. Yes, really, Gerald
reflected, that code was rather a beautiful idea to
play with. It was an excellent thing to be a gentleman:
but it proved always fatal, too, in the end,
simply because no lady was a gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it was that poor devil in the library who
was now involved in the dangerous task of carrying
through an adultery in Lichfield after the fashion of
well-bred persons. It was in his ears that a still rather
dear but too damnably adhesive Evelyn would be
bleating every day a reiteration of the fact that she
had trusted him and had given him all. And Gerald
himself, having decorously laid down his life rather
than violate this dreadful code of a gentleman, was
now fairly in train to become a competent magician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not ever again would he sit writing among those
bookshelves, engrossed, and rubbing at his chin or
forehead, or scratching his head, or sticking his little
finger into his ear, or restively shifting his weight
from one buttock to the other buttock, in his multiform
efforts to quicken, somehow, the flow of lagging
thought. He would pause no more to prop his
chin (with an unpleasantly moist hand, as a rule),
and thus to stare lack-wittedly at one or another of
the china and brass toys which he had, quite as idiotically,
collected to make vivid his bookshelves. All
these queer exercises, as Gerald, standing there, had
seen them in the last few minutes performed by the
natural body of Gerald Musgrave, did, manifestly,
not constitute an engaging or a sane way of spending
the evening, in a somewhat stuffy room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, he was now, forever, very happily done with
all these forlorn gymnastics. It was only the natural
body of Gerald Musgrave which henceforward
would, before this commensurately irrational audience
of small elephants and dogs and parrots and
chicken, go through these foolish writhing antics, in
that wholly nice looking young idiot’s endeavor to
complete the romance about Dom Manuel of
Poictesme.... Well, one could but wish the poor
devil joy of his bargain! and it no longer really mattered
that all which pertained to Gerald Musgrave
was rather droll, Gerald decided, as he passed out of
sight of that red head bent over that incessant pen
scratching.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>G</span></span>ERALD descended nineteen steps; and in the
dusk he found waiting there, beside a tethered
riding-horse, yet another young man, with
hair as red as Gerald Musgrave’s own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you may travel the more quickly, along a
woman-haunted way, in your journeying toward your
appointed goal,” this stranger began, “I have
fetched a horse for you to ride upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the speaker was not wholly a stranger. So
Gerald now said, “Oh, so it is you!” As a student
of magic, Gerald had held earlier dealings with
this red-haired Horvendile, who was Lord of the
Marches of Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald went on, gratefully: “Come now,
but this is kind! Even as a courtesy between fellow
artists, this is generous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The amenities of fellow artists,” returned Horvendile,
“are by ordinary two-edged. And this one
may cut deeper than you foreknow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile you have brought me this huge shining
horse, which cannot be other than Pegasus—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether or not this divine steed be that Pegasus
which bears romantics even to the ultimate goal of
their dreams, depends upon the horseman. It has been
prophesied, however, that the Redeemer of Antan
and the monarch who shall reign, after the overthrow
of the Master Philologist, in the place beyond
good and evil, will come riding upon the silver stallion
that is called, not Pegasus, but Kalki—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! oh!” said Gerald: and for an instant he
considered this surprising turn of affairs. To reign
in Antan had, very certainly, been no part of his
modest plans; but he saw at once how much more
becoming it would be, and how much better suited
to his real merits, to enter into Antan as its heir apparent,
resistless upon the silver stallion famous in
old prophecies, rather than to come as a suppliant
begging for a few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prophecies,” said Gerald, then, “ought to be
respected by all well brought up persons. Only, does
this horse happened to be Kalki? Because, you see,
Horvendile, that appears to be the whole point of the
prophecy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather oddly, Horvendile said, “Whether or not
this divine steed be that Kalki which bears romantics
even to the ultimate goal of all the gods, depends
upon the horseman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald considered this saying. Gerald smiled, and
Gerald remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but now I comprehend you! The rider and
the owner of any horse is, quite naturally, entitled
to call the animal whatsoever he prefers. Very well,
then! I shall christen this riding-horse Kalki. Yes,
Horvendile, upon mature deliberation, I will accept
the throne of Antan, without considering my personal
preferences and my dislike of publicity and
ostentation, in order that the prophecy may be fulfilled,
because that is always a good thing for prophecies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since that is your decision, Gerald, you have but,
after you have paid homage here, to mount intrepidly.
And the divine steed will carry you upon no
common road, but, since he is divine, along that way
which the gods and the great myths pursue in their
journeying toward Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is appropriate, of course, that I should travel
on the road patronized by the best classes. Nevertheless,
it would, I think, be a rather beautiful
idea—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, also,” said Horvendile, “and all
the while that you waste in talking about beautiful
ideas, there is a man’s homage to be paid here; and
moreover, at the first gap of the Doonham, the
Princess awaits you with some impatience. It would
not be going too far to say, indeed, that she hungers
for your coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now, but the things you tell me steadily
become more palatable!” remarked Gerald, as he
approached the huge stallion. “Now that I have accepted
the responsibilities of a throne and of all the
great and best words of the Master Philologist, it
would be most unbecoming for a princess to be ignored
by anyone who already is virtually a reigning
monarch. There are amenities to be preserved between
royal houses. Very terrible wars have sprung
from the omission of such amenities. So do you lead
me forthwith to this impatient princess; but do you
first tell me the adorable name of her highness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horvendile answered, “The princess who just
now awaits you is Evasherah, the Lady of the First
Water-Gap of Doonham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I admit that the information, now I have it,
means very little. Nevertheless, my dear fellow, do
you direct me to the water-gap of this princess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, I repeat, it would be wise for you, before
departing from this place, to render a man’s homage
to the ruler of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Horvendile, the name of this tropical,
damp, and this rather curious smelling country is no
doubt better known to you than, I confess, it stays
to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This place has not any name in the reputable
speech of men. It is the realm of Koleos Koleros.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that name Gerald bowed his head; and, as became
a student of magic, he courteously made the
appropriate sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said: “Very dreadful is the name of
Koleos Koleros! Yet, quite apart from the fact that
I am a member of the Protestant Episcopal church,
I owe this Koleos Koleros no homage. And I, very
certainly, shall not linger to pay any, with a princess
waiting for me! Rather, do I elect to pass hastily
through this land of quags and underbrush, and to
leave this somewhat unsanitarily odored neighborhood,
in which, I perceive, misguided persons yet
live—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For these two young men were no longer alone
in this ambiguous valley. Through the twilight Gerald
now saw many women passing furtively toward
a dark laurel grove; and from out of that grove
came a queer music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Horvendile spoke of these women.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>6.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Evadne of the Dusk</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW all the while that Horvendile talked it
was to the accompaniment of that remote
queer music: and Gerald was troubled. He
came, at least, as near to being troubled as Gerald
ever permitted himself to do. For Gerald did not
really enjoy trouble of any kind, and said frankly
that he found it uncongenial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But these,” said Gerald, by and by, “all these,
my dear fellow, I had thought to have perished a long
while ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You travel, Gerald, on the road of the greater
myths. Such myths do not perish speedily. And, besides,
nothing is true anywhere in the Marches of
Antan. All is a seeming and an echo: and through
this superficies men come to know the untruth
which makes them free. It follows, in my logic, that
to-day these women are the flute-players of Koleos
Koleros. They serve to-day, forever unsatiated, that
most insatiable divinity who is shaggy and evil-odored,
and who can taste no pleasure until after
bloodshed—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have read, also,” Gerald broke in, with the
slight smile of one who is not unpleased to display
his learning, “that this Koleos Koleros is a somewhat
contradictory goddess, producing the less the
more constantly that she is cultivated and stirred
up—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho, but a most potent goddess is this Koleos
Koleros!” continued Horvendile. “She is wrinkled
and flabby in appearance, yet the most stout of heroes
falls at last before her. Infants perish nightly
in her gloomy vaults, and plagues and diseases
harbor there—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But again Gerald had interrupted him, saying:
“Yet I have read, moreover, that this modest and
retired Koleos Koleros, alone of eternal beings, is
ever ardent to quench the ardor of her servitors;
and that—still to praise merit where merit appears,—in
her untiring warfare with all men that
rise up to oppose her, she displays the magnanimity
to favor, and to embrace lovingly, the adversary
that attacks her most often and most deeply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horvendile thereupon held out his hand. He
showed thus the tip of his forefinger touching the
tip of his thumb so that they formed a circle. And
Horvendile said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She varies even as the moon varies. Yet equally
is this divine small monster the bestower of life and
of all joy; she charms in defiance of reason: and
whensoever Koleos Koleros appears, red and inflamed
and hideous among her tousled tresses, a
man is moved willy-nilly to place in her his chief
delight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho!” said Gerald, and, as became a student of
magic, he also made the needful sign, “oho, but a
most potent goddess is this Koleos Koleros!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, then,” continued Horvendile, “all they
who in this place serve eternally this most whimsical
divinity are a loving and a peculiarly happy people.
Their amorousness, which here is not ever blighted
by shrill reprobation, has need at no time to fear
either the chastisement of human law nor the anathemas
of any other religion anywhere in the quiet
brakes and lowlands of the moist realm of Koleos
Koleros. For, you conceive, these feminine myths
who now are flute-players in and about the shrine of
the wrinkled goddess, and who through so many
centuries have been trained in all the arts of pleasure,
came by and by into a certain confusion—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what sort of confusion, Horvendile, do you
mean? For I find your speaking another sort. And I
am rather more interested in that princess—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that their religion, which ranks pleasure
above all else, permits no man to pass by unpleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now I understand you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—I mean that, through the duties of their religious
faith, their way of living has been given over
to an assiduous and an empirical study of all the
charms peculiar to a woman, the more particularly
as these charms are employed—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us say, in the exercise of their religion,”
Gerald suggested, “for I wholly understand you,
sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has followed that the taste of these ladies has
become more delicate. It has followed that, by force
of considering their own feminine loveliness, always
unveiled and in lively employment, and by comparing
it so intimately and so jealously with the loveliness
of their female rivals in the service of the
wrinkled goddess, they have become connoisseurs of
the beauties peculiar to their sex. They have acquired
a refinement of taste—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be refined in one’s taste is eminently praiseworthy.
Ah, my dear fellow, if you but knew what
shocking examples of bad taste we kings are continually
encountering among our sycophants! And that
reminds me, you said something about a princess—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—They have learned to despise the hasty and
boisterous and, between ourselves, the very often
disappointing ways of men—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, no doubt!” said Gerald. “Men are a
bad lot. But we were speaking of a princess—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And they have lovingly contrived more finespun
and more rococo diversions without the crude
assistance of any man. Then also they delight in
playing with many well-trained pets,—with goats
and large dogs and asses and, they tell me, with rams
and with bulls also. The surprising and mysterious
joys which blaze up among these flute-players are,
thus, very violent and delicious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said then that kindness to dumb animals
was generally reckoned a most estimable trait in the
United States of America. Whereas, in all quarters
of that enlightened and hospitable republic, Gerald
estimated, a princess—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet,” Horvendile went on, “these learned
women do not forget, in mere pleasure-seeking, their
religious duty of permitting no man to pass by unpleased.
Go to them, therefore, you will be welcome.
Yonder at this instant a religious festival is preparing.
Yonder sweet-voiced Leucosia, who hereabouts
is called Evadne, waits for you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have not the honor of knowing this
Evadne—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is easily known, by her violet hair and her
sharp teeth. Moreover, Gerald, her wise sisters—Telês,
and Parthenopê, and Radnê, and Ligeia, and
Molpê,—all these will greet you with ardor. They
will deny to you no secret of their pious rites;
they will share with you esoteric joys religiously.
They will incite you to perform among their choir, in
the most secret shrine of Koleos Koleros—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, really now, my dear fellow! I have no
talent whatever for music. I would be quite out of
place in any choir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These flute-players are very ingenious. They
will find for you some suitable instrument. And there
will be strange harmonies and much soft laughter at
this festival: each reveller will pour out libations
copiously: cups will be refilled and emptied until
dawn. There will be for you perfumes and rose garlands
and the most exquisite of wines and the most
savory of dishes and other delicacies. Due homage
will be paid to Koleos Koleros.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless,” said Gerald, “there is a phrase
which haunts me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That dusky grove of laurels yonder is the hall
of this pious feast. Nothing will be lacking to you at
this feast if you attend it with proper religious exaltation;
and you will discover abilities there which
will surprise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, as to that now, Horvendile—! Yes, I have
a man’s proper share of ability, I have quite enough
ability for two persons. Nevertheless, there is a patriotic
phrase which haunts me, and that phrase is
<span class='it'>E pluribus unum</span>. For I have compunctions, Horvendile,
which are translating that same phrase, a little
freely, as ‘One among so many.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me a harmless phrase even in your
paraphrase. More harm may very well come of the
fact that these learned ladies will endeavor to cajole
you out of the divine steed, so that he may be added
to their trained pets—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! oh, indeed!” said Gerald. “But that is
nonsense. The rider upon Kalki, and none other, has
to fulfil that estimable old prophecy: and a deal of
good such wheedlings will do any woman breathing,
with a fine kingdom like that of mine set against a
mere kiss or, it may be, a few tears!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That matter remains to be attested in due time.
Meanwhile, I can but repeat that if you do not
render a man’s homage to the ruler of this place
there is no doubt whatever that the slighted goddess
will avenge herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” Gerald now replied, with appropriate dignity,
“I am, as were my fathers before me, a member
of the Protestant Episcopal church. Is it thinkable
that a communicant of this persuasion would
worship a goddess of the benighted heathen? Do
you but answer me that very simple question!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Lichfield,” Horvendile retorted, “to adhere
to the religion of your fathers is tactful, and in this
place also, as in every other place, tactfulness ought
to be every wise man’s religion. Otherwise, you will
be running counter to that which is expected of the
descendants of Manuel and of Jurgen; and you may
by and by have cause to regret it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerald thought of his church, and of its handsome
matters of faith in the way of organ music and
of saints’ days and of broad-mindedness and of delightful
lawn-sleeved bishops and of majestic rituals.
He thought of newly washed choir-boys and of his
prayer-book’s wonderful mouth-filling phrases, of
rogation days and of ember days and of Trinity
Sunday. He thought about pulpits and hassocks and
stained glass and sextons, and about the Thirty-nine
Articles, and about those unpredictable, superb
mathematics which early in every spring collaborated
with the new moon to afford him an Easter:
and these things Gerald could not abandon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he said: “No. No, Horvendile! I pay no
homage to the wrinkled goddess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Horvendile warned him again, “You may
find that decision costly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is as it may be!” said Gerald, with his
chin well up. “For a good Episcopalian, sir, finds in
the petulance of no heathen goddess anything to
blench the cheek and make the heart go pitapat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, he looked rather fondly through the dusk.
And now his shoulders also went up, shruggingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I concede,” said Gerald, “that, howsoever
firm my churchmanship, and even with a princess
waiting for me, I am tempted. For yonder flute-player
who still delays to join her companions—who
are now, no doubt, already about their merry
games with one another and with their trained pets,—has
charms. Yes, she has charms which give my
thoughts, as it were, a locally religious turn, and make
the notion of joining her a rather beautiful idea. I
deplore, of course, her feathered legs. Even so, she
displays, as you too may observe, in her so leisurely
retreat, an opulence in that most engaging kind of
beauty which once got for Aphrodite the epithet of
Callipygê. I contemplate, with at least locally pious
joy, the curving of those reins, the whiteness and the
fineness of the skin, and the graciousness of those superb
contours, designed without any stinting or exaggeration,
into the perfection of those fair twin
moons of delight—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in a moment Gerald said, “Still, there is
something vaguely familiar, a something which chills
me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said also: “Or, rather, in their so
gentle undulations as she walks unhurriedly away
from us, in their so amiable convulsions,—in their
heavings, their twitchings, their ripplings and their
twinklings,—rather, do the bewitching and multitudinous
movements of those silvery spheres resemble,
to my half dazzled eyes, the unarithmeticable
smiling of the sunlit sea, to which, as you will
remember, Horvendile, old Æschylos has so finely
referred. I feel that I could compose a not discreditable
sonnet to that most beautiful of backsides.
There is nothing more poetical than is the backside
of a naked woman who is walking away from you.
Its movements awaken the yearnings of all elegiac
verse.... And I do not doubt, sir, that the front
of this feathery-legged lady is fully as enchanting as
the rear. Yes, I imagine that the façade too has its
own peculiar attractions: and I admit, in a word,
that I am tempted to confront her—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horvendile glanced toward the woman who alone
remained within reach. “That is Evadne, who in the
days of her sea-faring was called Leucosia. And it is
plain enough that she waits for temptation to inflame
and to uplift you into raptures somewhat more
practical than all this talking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She waits,” said Gerald, “in vain. At this distance
she is a rather beautiful idea: nearer, she
would be only another woman with her clothes off.
Moreover, sir, I am a self-respecting member of the
Protestant Episcopal church: and besides that, as I
now perceive, it is of Evelyn Townsend’s figure that
this woman’s half-seen figure reminds me. That resemblance
makes for every sedentary virtue. I have
learned only too well what comes of permitting any
female person to trust you and to give you all. Then,
too, I am called to duties of more honor and responsibility
in my appointed kingdom. And for the
rest, I prefer to disappoint these ladies by failing in
ardor at such a distance as will not provoke my
blushes. No, Horvendile: no, I am still haunted by
that patriotic phrase <span class='it'>E pluribus unum</span>; and I shall
not just now presume to render a man’s homage to
Koleos Koleros, among quite so many flute-players.
Moreover, you assert that a princess is waiting for
me, to whom I prefer to present the member of another
royal house in the full possession of all faculties.
So I do not elect, just now, to share in these—if
you will permit the criticism,—somewhat un-American
methods of religious exercise. I ask, instead,
that you conduct me to the impatient princess
about whom you keep talking so obstinately that, I
perceive, there is no least hope of my stopping you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this way that Gerald began his journey
by putting an affront upon Koleos Koleros.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>7.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Evasherah of the First Water-Gap</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“A</span></span> GOOD-MORNING to you, ma’am,” Gerald
had begun. His horse was tethered to a
palm-tree, and Horvendile was gone, so that
there now was only the Princess to be considered.
“And in what way can I be of any service?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet his voice shook, as he stood there beside the
alabaster couch.... For Gerald was enraptured.
The Princess Evasherah was, in the dawn of this
superb May morning, so surpassingly lovely that she
excelled all the other women his gaze had ever beheld.
Her face was the proper shape, it was appropriately
colored everywhere, and it was surmounted
with an adequate quantity of hair. Nor was it possible
to find any defect in her features. The colors of
this beautiful young girl’s two eyes were nicely
matched, and her nose stood just equidistant between
them. Beneath this was her mouth, and she
had also a pair of ears. In fine, the girl was young,
she exhibited no deformity anywhere, and the enamored
glance of the young man could perceive in
her no fault. She reminded him, though, of someone
that he had known....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the ardent reflections which had passed
through Gerald’s mind in the while that he said decorously,
“A good-morning, ma’am: and in what
way can I be of any service?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Princess, in her impetuous royal fashion,
had wasted no time upon the formal preliminaries
which were more or less customary in Lichfield. And
while Gerald’s patriotic republican rearing had been
explicit enough as to the goings-on in monarchical
families, he was whole-heartedly astounded by the
animation and candor which here confronted him.
There was no possible doubting that the Princess
Evasherah was prepared to trust him and to give
him all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, oh, indeed, ma’am,” Gerald said, “you
quite misunderstand me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For he had it now. This woman was uncommonly
like Evelyn Townsend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald sighed. All ardor had departed from him.
And with a few well-chosen words he placed their
relationship upon a more decorous basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Princess Evasherah, that most lovely
Lady of the Water-Gap, was lying down even when
Gerald first came to her, just after sunrise. She was
lying upon a couch of alabaster, which had four
legs made of elephants’ tusks. Upon this couch was
a mattress covered with green satin and embroidered
with red gold; upon the mattress was the
Princess Evasherah in a brief shirt of apricot
colored silk; and, over all, was a saffron canopy
adorned with fig-leaves worked in pearls and
emeralds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This couch was furthermore shaded by three
palm-trees, and it stood near to the bank of the river
called Doonham. And by the sparkling ripples of
that river’s deep waters—as the Princess Evasherah
explained, some while after she and Gerald
had reached a friendly and clean-minded understanding,
with no un-American nonsense about it,—was
hidden the residence of the Princess, where presently
they would have breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” Gerald said, a little dejectedly, “I have
just now no appetite of any kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will not matter,” said the Princess: and
for no reason at all she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And to live under the water, ma’am, appears
a virtually unprecedented form of royal eccentricity—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but I must tell you, lord of the age, and
most obdurate averter from the desirer of union
with him, that very long ago, because of a girlish
infatuation for a young man whose name I have
forgotten, I suffered a fiery downfalling from the
Home of the Heavenly Ones, into the waters of this
river. For I had offended my Father (whose name
be exalted!) by stealing six drops of quite another
kind of water, of the water from the Churning of
the Ocean—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” Gerald said, “but do you mean the
divine Amrita?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garden of my joys, and summit of sagacity,” the
Princess remarked, “you are learned. You have
knowledge of heavenly matters, you have traversed
the Nine Spaces. And I perceive that you who travel
overburdened with unresponsiveness upon this road
of the gods are yet another god in disguise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, ma’am, it is merely that, as a student of
magic, one picks up such bits of information. I am
the heir apparent to a throne, I cannot honestly
declare myself any more than that: and I am upon
my way to enter into my kingdom, but it is not, I am
tolerably certain, a celestial kingdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Princess was not convinced. “No, my preceptor
and my only idol, it is questionless you are a
god, all perfect in eloquence and in grace, a temptation
unto lovers, and showing as a visible paradise to
the desirous. Here, in any event, out of my keen
regard for your virtues, and in exchange for that
great gawky horse of yours which reveals in every
feature its entire unworthiness of contact with divine
buttocks, here are the five remaining drops, in this
little vial—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald inspected the small crystal bottle quite as
sceptically as the Princess had regarded his disclaimer
of being a god. “Well, now, ma’am, to me
this looks like just ordinary water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She placed one drop of the water upon her finger-tip.
She drew upon his forehead the triangle of the
male principle, she drew the female triangle, so that
one figure interpenetrated the other, and she invoked
Monachiel, Ruach, Achides, and Degaliel.
No student of magic could fail to recognize her employment
of an interesting if uncanonical variant of
the Third Pentacle of Venus, but Gerald made no
comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that the Princess Evasherah laughed merrily.
“Now, then, companion of my heart, now that
you have promised me that utterly contemptible
horse of yours, I unmask you. For I perceive that
you, O my master, more comely than the moon, are
the predestined Redeemer of Antan—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That much, ma’am, I already know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short,” said the Princess, “you are Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord of
the Third Truth, the Well-beloved of Heavenly
Ones, thus masked in human flesh and in human forgetfulness
and in peculiarly unhuman coldness. Yet
very soon the power of the Amrita will have bestowed
unfailing vigorousness upon your thinking,
and presently the hounds of recollection will have
run down the hare of your inestimable glory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is well said, ma’am. It is spoken with a fine
sense of style. And I conjecture that, although the
better stylists usually omit this ingredient, it has
some meaning also.... Yes, you do allude to my
having red hair, but the hare of my inestimable
glory, which you likewise mention, is not capillary,
but zoölogical,—in addition to being also metaphorical....
You state, in brief, in a figurative Oriental
way, that by and by I shall recollect something
which I have forgotten.... But just what is it,
ma’am, that you so confidently expect me to recollect?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, and acme of my contentment, you will
recall, for one matter, the love that was between us
in this world’s infancy, when you did not avert from
me the inspiring glances of fond affection. For you,
the bright-tressed, the resplendent, are unmistakably
the Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones. I perfectly remember
you, by your high nose, by your jutting chin,
and by the eminence of yet another feature whose
noble proportions also very deeply delighted me during
my visit to your Dirghic paradise, and which I
perceive to remain unabatedly heroic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald, gently, but with decision, took hold of her
hand. It seemed to him quite time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the fair Lady of the Water-Gap, she who
would have been so adorable if only she had not reminded
Gerald more and more of Evelyn Townsend,
began to talk about matters which Gerald as yet
really did not remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of Gerald’s golden and high-builded
home, in which, it seemed, this Princess had trusted
him and had given him all: and she spoke also of
the unresting love for mankind which had led Gerald
to quit that exalted home, among the untroubled
lotus-ponds of Vaikuntha, upon nine earlier occasions,
and of his nine fine exploits in the way of redemption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of how Gerald had visited men sometimes
in his present heroic and elegant form, at other
times in the appearance of a contemptible looking
dwarf, and upon yet other occasions as a tortoise
and as a boar pig and as a lion and as a large fish.
His taste in apparel seemed as fickle as his charitableness
was firm. For over and over again, the Princess
said, it had been the power of Gerald, as
Helper and Preserver, which had prevented several
nations and a dynasty or two of gods from being
utterly destroyed by demons whom Gerald himself
had destroyed. It was Gerald, as he learned now,
who had preserved this earth alike from depopulation
and from ignorance, when during the first great
flood the Lord of the Third Truth, in his incarnation
as a great fish, had carried through the deluge seven
married couples and four books containing the cream
of earth’s literature: whereas, later, during a yet
more severe inundation, Gerald had held up the
earth itself between his tusks,—this being, of
course, in the time of his incarnation as a boar pig,—and
swimming thus, had preserved the endangered
planet from being as much as mildewed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Evasherah spoke also of how when Gerald
was a tortoise he had created such matters as the
first elephant, the first cow, and the first wholly amiable
woman. He had created at the same time, she
added, the moon and the great jewel Kaustubha and
a tree called Parijata, which yielded whatever was
desired of it, and it was then also that Fair-haired
Hoo, the Well-beloved Lord of the Third Truth,
had invented drunkenness. There had been, in all,
Evasherah concluded, nineteen supreme and priceless
benefits invented by Gerald at this time, but she
confessed her inability to recall offhand everyone of
them—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is sufficient,—oh, quite sufficient!” Gerald assured
her, with wholly friendly condescension, “for
already, ma’am, it embarrasses me to have my modest
philanthropies catalogued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Gerald, howsoever lightly he spoke, was
thrilled with not uncomplacent pride in his past. He
was not actually surprised, of course, because logic
had already pointed out that the ruler of Antan
would very naturally be a divine personage with just
such a magnificent past. To be a god appeared to
him a rather beautiful idea. So he first asked what
was the meaning of that skull over yonder in the
grass: the Princess explained that it was not her skull,
but had been left there by a visitor some two months
earlier: and then Gerald, after having agreed with
her that people certainly ought to be more careful
about their personal belongings, went on with what
was really in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In any event, ma’am,” he hazarded, with the
brief cough of diffidence, “it seems there have been
tender passages between us before this morning—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trusted you! I gave you all!” she said, reproachfully.
“But you, disposer of supreme delights, and
fair vase of my soul, you have forgotten even the
way you used to take advantage of my confidence!
For how can the modesty of a frail woman
avail against the brute strength of a determined
man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Evelyn, not to-night—I beg your pardon,
ma’am! My mind was astray. What I meant to say
was that I really must request you to desist.” Then
Gerald went on, tenderly: “To the contrary, my
dear lady, our love stays unforgettable. I recall every
instant of it, I bear in mind even that sonnet which
I made for you on the evening of my first respectful
declaration of undying affection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, that lovely sonnet!” the Princess remarked,
with the uneasiness manifested by every
normal woman when a man begins to talk about
poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And to prove it, I will now recite that sonnet,”
Gerald said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet his voice was so shaken with emotion that,
when he had completed the octave, Gerald paused,
because it was never within Gerald’s power to resist
the beauty of a sublime thought when it was thus
adequately expressed in flawless verse. So for an instant
he stayed silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught up the lovely, always straying hands
of the Princess Evasherah, of this impulsive and
investigatory lady, who so troublingly resembled
Evelyn Townsend, and Gerald pressed these hands
to his trembling lips. This lovely girl, returned to
him almost miraculously, it might seem, out of his
well-nigh forgotten past, was not merely intent once
more to trust him and to give him all. She trusted
also, as Gerald felt with that keen penetration which
is natural to divine beings, to delude and to wheedle
him into some material loss. What the Princess desired
to cajole him out of was, perhaps, not wholly
clear. Nevertheless, he felt that, in some way or another
way, Evasherah was attempting to deceive him.
It might be that neither her explanation as to that
skull nor even her so candid seeming adoration of
his wisdom and his comeliness was entirely sincere.
For women were like that: they did not always mean
every word they said, not even when they were addressing
a god. And so, the gods had over-painful
duties laid upon them, Gerald decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that he sighed: and he continued the reciting
of his sonnet with an air of lofty resignation, with
which was intermingled a certain gustatory approval
of really good verse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Light of my universe, that is a very beautiful
sonnet,” the Princess remarked, when he had finished,
“and I am proud to have inspired it, and I am
almost equally proud of the fact that you (through
whose supreme elegance and amiable aspect my heart
is once more rent with ecstasy) should remember
it so well after these thousands of years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Years mean very little, ma’am, to Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord of the
Third Truth, the Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones:
and centuries are, quite naturally, powerless to dim
my memories of any matter in any way pertaining to
you. Yet affairs of minor importance do rather tend
to become a bit ambiguous as the æons slip by....
For example, what, in the intervals between my redemptory
exploits—upon mere week days, as it
were,—what do I happen to be the god of?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said the Princess, “O my master, and
pure fountain-head of every virtue, is a peculiarly
silly question to be coming from you, who are, as
everybody knows, the Lord of the Third Truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, to be sure,—of the Third Truth! My
divine interests are invested in veracity. Well, that
is highly gratifying. Yet, ma’am, there are a great
many gods, and it is a rather beautiful idea to observe
that, even where their professional spheres
are the same, these gods differ remarkably. Thus,
Vulcan is the lord of one fire, and Vesta of another,
but Agni and Fudo and Satan rule over yet other
fires, each wholly individual. Cupid and Lucina traffic
in the same port, but not in the same way. Æolus
controls twelve winds, and Tezcatlipoca four winds,
and Crepitus only one wind—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Director of my life, and comely shepherd of my
soul, I know. Few gods are strange to me or to my
embraces. Many a Heavenly One has invited me to
love, and I have yielded piously: my kisses have written
the tale of my religious transports upon many
divine cheeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And I imagine that this water from the Churning
of the Ocean was not intended, in the first place,
to further my apotheosis. I mean, ma’am, I do not
suppose you went to the trouble of stealing six drops
of the Amrita in order just to recall to me that
divinity which, in the press of other affairs, I had
somehow permitted to slip my mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disposer and sole archetype of the seven magnanimities,
you speak the truth. For the five remaining
drops, as I was trying to tell you when you kept
interrupting me, O my lord, and beloved of my heart,
and joy of both my eyes, were intended for the five
human senses of the young man about whom I was
then rather foolish; and upon whom I meant to bestow
immortality and eternal youth. The first drop,
inasmuch as the Amrita confers a never-ending vigorousness,
I had of course already placed. So my Father
(whose name be exalted!) smote us both with
lightnings, in his impetuous way, and tumbled us both
from out of the Home of the Heavenly Ones into
this river. My young man was thus drowned before
I had the chance to confer upon him any of the
favors which I greatly fear your superior strength
and your pertinacity are now about to force from
me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied: “I really do think you would get
on far more quickly with your story if you were to
keep both of these like this. The position, you see,
is much more American: it lacks that earlier air of
such personal freedom as a democracy does not think
well of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Light of the age, I hear and I obey. Yet all my
tale has been revealed to your consideration—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Gerald assented, “but your history interests
me far more—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Far more than what, O cruel and resplendent
one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, far more than I can say, of course. So
let us get on with it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my sad history is now as refined glass before
your discerning glance. It suffices to add that
the immortal part of my young man was happily removed
from the waters of this river, and is now
worshipped as a god in Lytreia. But for me, alas!
the squirrel of calamity continued to revolve in the
cage of divine wrath. For, so perfectly ridiculous is
the way my Father (whose name be exalted!) behaves
when the least thing upsets him, that I was
condemned through the length of nine thousand
years to assume certain official duties in the
waters of this river, in the repugnant shape of a
crocodile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with that statement Gerald took prompt issue.
“What may be your official duties as the guardian
of these waters I can no more guess than I can guess
how your visitors happen to be so careless about
leaving their skulls behind. That really is a sort of
slapdash and inconsiderate behavior which I cannot
condone without considerable reflection. But I do
know that the shape which I have beheld, and still
see a great deal of, in nothing resembles the shape of
a crocodile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Epitome of every excellence, and exalted zenith
of my existence, that is because the nine thousand
years of my doom have now happily expired. The
proof of this is that already my luckless substitute
arrives. We shall now behold her encounter with the
terminator of delights and the separator of companions.
Thereafter, when we have had breakfast,
O vital spirit of my heart, whom my unmitigated love
incites me to devour out of pure affection, I shall
ride hence upon the horse with which you have so
gallantly presented me, to enter again into the Home
of the Heavenly Ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that, the Princess pointed.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>8.<br> <span class='sub-head'>The Mother of Every Princess</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>W</span></span>ITH that, the Princess pointed. And Gerald
also now looked toward the river....
He viewed an unsolid-seeming world of
dimly colored movings. Directly before him the deep
river sparkled and rippled eastward with unhurried,
very shallow undulations. But, under the sun’s
warmth, mists rising everywhere above the waters
streamed eastward too, unhastily, and in such unequal
volume that now this and now another portion
of the wide landscape beyond the river was irregularly
glimpsed and then, gradually but with a
surprising quickness, veiled. Very lovely medallions
of green lawns and shrubbery and distant hills thus
seemed to take form and then to dissolve into the
mists’ incessant gray flowing, toward the newly risen
sun....</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald also saw that, some fifty feet away
from him, an unusually unclad elderly woman was
approaching the river bank, carrying in her thin
arms a child. The woman trudged forward toward
the river like a drugged person, because of the doom
which was upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this woman seemed to stumble, and she fell
into the water, but in falling she cast the child from
her, so that it remained safe in the coarse tall-growing
grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman whom divine will had led hither to
serve as a scapegoat for the Princess Evasherah
proceeded to drown satisfactorily, and with indeed
a sort of decorum. She sank twice, with hardly any
beating or splashing of the waters, because of that
doom which was upon her. The child, though, whom
no long years of living had taught to accept a preponderance
of unpleasant happenings, screamed continuously,
in candid, mewing disapproval of divine
will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the near-by reeds came a bright-eyed
jackal; and it furtively approached the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Princess rose from the alabaster couch and
from Gerald’s partially detaining arms. She stood
for an instant irresolute. In her lovely face was
trouble. Her mouth, a little open, trembled. Gerald
liked that. Here was revealed the ever-tender heart
of womanhood and the quick generous sympathy with
all afflicted persons which living had taught him to
look for only in the best literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Princess quitted Gerald. She hastened to the
river bank. The jackal backed from her, crouching in
a half-circle, with bared teeth, and the reeds swallowed
the beast. The Princess leaned down, and with
a lovely gesture of compassion the Princess caught
the drowning woman by one hand and assisted her
ashore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that the Princess Evasherah cried out
in wordless surprise. Then too her raised hands
clenched, and her little fists jerked downward in a
gesture of candid exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then also the woman whom the Princess had
just saved from drowning unfastened the small copper
bowl and the knife which hung by copper chains
about her waist. The Princess took these, she approached
the wailing child, she stooped, and the crying
ceased. The Princess returned to the strange
woman, calling out, “Hrang, hrang!” To the gray
lips of this woman Evasherah applied the blood
which was now in the copper bowl, and the remainder
of the child’s blood she sprinkled over the woman’s
unveiled breasts and between the woman’s legs, which
were held wide apart for this fecundation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hail, Mother!” said Evasherah. “All hail, O
red and wrinkled Mother of Every Princess! Hail,
patient and insatiable Havvah! A salutation to thee!
Spheng, spheng! a salutation to thee, and all delight
to thee for a thousand years of thy Wednesdays!
Drink deep, beloved and wise Mother, for an oblation
of blood which has been rendered pure by holy
texts is more sweet than ambrosia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the elder lady had seemed peculiarly red
and inflamed and hideous among her tousled tresses.
Now she was placated, she panted, and her eyes
rolled languorously. She began, with aggrieved
reproach, “But, O my dearie! you have relapsed
into a masculine display of clemency such as has flung
away your allotted chance of redemption.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorrow and mourning reside in my heart, O
my Mother: my limbs are rendered infirm by remorse.
For I had no least notion it was you. I
thought only that some mortal woman was to take
over my duties in the repulsive shape of a crocodile;
and I could not bear to hear the small voice of the
little child crying out as the sharp jackal teeth drew
nearer, and to reflect that I was destroying two lives
in order to purchase my freedom from this endless
love-making and over-eating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it was a boy child. Dearie, you are talking
as though these sons of Adam were of real importance.
And to hear you, nobody would ever give you
your due credit for having piously ended the ambitions
of so many hundreds of them, since you have
protected the entrance to the road of gods and myths
against the impudence of these romantics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, refuge of the uplifted, and asylum of the
vigorous, the persons whose blood has nourished my
exile were all young men aflame with impure intentions.
And a child is different. It is not right that the
stainless flesh of a little boy, which is an offering acceptable
to all our exalted race, should be torn by the
long teeth of an undomesticated dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true. That is alike a truthful and a pious
reflection. A child is different from all other afflictions,
because a child alone can always be an endless
and a quite new sort of trouble. That nobody knows
better than I who am the Mother of Every Princess,
with my daughters everywhere policing the wild
dreams of men so inadequately. Yet a thing done has
an end. And it may be that by and by I can get around
your Father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose name be exalted!” remarked Evasherah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That also, dearie, is a wholly proper observation,—though,
as I was saying, you know as well as
I do how pig-headed he is. Meanwhile, there is
nothing left for you, for the present, save another
incarnation, and another century or two of seductiveness
upon the verge of Doonham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have been,” observed the Princess, “a
crocodile professionally for nine thousand years, for
all that my chest is so delicate. The cats of conjecture
are therefore abroad in the meadows of my meditation
purring that this time I would prefer something
a little less damp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearie, since your next incarnation is but a matter
of form, do you by all means please yourself, so
that you stay a destruction to young men and to
their upsetting aspirations. You have been wholly
inadequate this morning, I observe—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, but—” said the abashed Princess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice sank as she went on rather ruefully with
a talking which to Gerald was now inaudible. He
could merely see that the elder lady had hazarded
a suggestion which Evasherah at once dismissed
with an emphatic toss of her lovely head. He saw
too the Princess place together the palms of her
hands and then draw them about seven inches apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, fully that, at first!” she stated, in the raised
tones of mild exasperation, “so that, altogether, this
unresponsive person (within whose ancestral tomb
may all goats propagate!) remains quite incomprehensible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman replied: “In any event, you have
failed; but that does not really matter. He travels,
you assure me, with his assured betrayer. And the
road he follows, that also, is lively enough and long
enough to betray him in the end. For he will meet
others of my daughters; and if all else fails, he will
meet me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ship of my enduring resolution is not yet
wrecked upon the iceberg of his indifference; and I
am not through with him, by any means. I am returning
to this unremunerative occupier of my couch,—for
breakfast, O my Mother,” the Princess added,
with a merry laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the old lady answered her with a mother’s
ever-responsive tenderness. “That is my own child.
One has to persevere with these romantics, no matter
how hard the task may seem. For none of us knows
yet what these romantic men desire. My daughters
prepare for them fine food and drink, my daughters
see to it that their homes are snug, and at the end of
each day my daughters love them dutifully. All things
that men can ask for, my daughters furnish them.
Why need so many of these men nurse strange desires
which do not know their aim? for how can any
of my daughters content such desires?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One can but summon, O my Mother, the terminator
of delights and the separator of companions
and the ender of all desires.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other ways, my dearie, which are
more subtle. That way is of the East, that way is old
and crude. Still, that way also quiets over-ambitious
dreaming; and that way serves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald blinked. He was a bit troubled by the
matter-of-fact occurrence before his eyes of a perfectly
incredible happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the elder lady became transfigured. She became
larger, all ruddiness went away from her, and
she took on the black and livid coloring of a thunder
cloud. In her left hand she now carried a pair of
scales and a yardstick. Her face smiled rather terribly
as she steadily grew larger. Her necklace, you
perceived, was made of human skulls, and each of her
earrings was the dangling corpse of a hanged man in
a very poor state of preservation. Altogether, it was
not a grief to Gerald when the Mother of Every
Princess had attained to her full heavenly stature,
and had vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Lady of the Water-Gap was changed in
quite another fashion. Where she had stood now
fluttered a large black and yellow butterfly.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>9.<br> <span class='sub-head'>How One Butterfly Fared</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>S</span></span>O it was in the shape of a large butterfly that
Evasherah returned toward Gerald, to careen
and drift affectionately about him, in a bewildering
medley of bright colors. He cried to her adoringly,
“My darling—!” He grasped at her: and
she did not avoid him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald now held this lovely creature, by the
throat, at arm’s length. He began the compelling
words, “Schemhamphoras—” And in Gerald’s face
was no adoration whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead, he continued, rather sadly, “—Eloha,
Ab, Bar, Ruachaccocies—” and so went through
the entire awful list, ending by and by with “Cados.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His prey was now struggling frantically. The unreflective
girl had not allowed for her lover’s being
a student of magic. And her restiveness was—well,
it might be, pardonably,—a bit interfering with
Gerald’s æsthetic delight, now that he paused to admire
the splendor of the trapped Princess’s last incarnation,
before he used the fatal Hausa charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Evasherah’s wings were of a wonderful velvety
black and a fiery orange color, her body was
golden, and her breast crimson. He noted also that
Evasherah, in her increasing agitation of mind, had
thrust out from the back of her neck a soft forked
horn which diffused a horrible odor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And those curved, strong, needle-sharp fangs
which were striking vainly at him were so adroitly
designed that Gerald fell now to marveling, still a
little sadly, at their superb efficiency. A yellowish oil
oozed from their tips. They had, he saw, just the
curve of two cat claws: whensoever such fangs struck
flesh, their victim’s recoil would but clamp fangs
which were shaped like that more deeply and more
venomously; it was a quite ingenious arrangement.
It perfectly explained, too, how the visitors of this
soft-spoken, cuddling and utterly adorable Princess
happened to leave their skulls in the thick grass
around her alabaster couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “O Butterfly, O Gleaming
One, your breakfast this day is disappointment, your
fork is agony, and your napkin death. O Butterfly,
repent truly, abandon falsehood, put away deceit and
flattery, cease thinking about your deluded lovers
even remorsefully. Repent in verity, do not repent
like the wildcat which repents with the fowl in its
mouth without putting the fowl down. Where now is
the artfulness which was yours, where are the high-hearted,
tricked lovers?—To-day all lies in the
tomb. This world, O Butterfly, is a market-place:
everyone comes and goes, both stranger and citizen.
The last of your lovers is a pious friend, he assists
the decreed course of this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, it was rather strange that the body she had
chosen appeared to belong to the species <span class='it'>Onithoptera
crœsus</span>,—Gerald decided, as his foot crushed the
squeaking soft remnants and rubbed all into a
smeared paste of blood and gold-dust,—because, of
course, this kind of butterfly was more properly indigenous
to the Malay Archipelago than to these
parts, over and above the fact that for any butterfly
to have the fangs of a serpent was false entomology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the geography and local customs and all
else which pertained to the Marches of Antan were
tinged with some perceptible inconsequence, Gerald
reflected, as he returned to his tethered stallion. He
mounted then, cheered with the yet further reflection
that he had got from Evasherah the rather beautiful
idea of being a god, and had got also the four remaining
drops from the Churning of the Ocean. The
properties of this water were sufficiently well known
to every student of magic.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW Gerald mounted on the stallion Kalki,
and Gerald traveled upon the way of gods
and myths, down a valley of cedar-trees,
into the realm of Glaum of the Haunting Eyes. The
land of Dersam was already falling away into desolation,
because of the disappearance of its liege-lord
into mortal living. And at Caer Omn, which formerly
had been the Sylan’s royal palace, and where
Gerald got his breakfast, the three hundred and
fifty-odd concubines of Glaum were about their cooking
and cleaning and nursing, but the seven wives of
Glaum sat together in a walled garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six of these wives were young and comely, but
the seventh seemed—to Gerald’s finding,—as wrinkled
as a wet fishnet, and as old as envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the half-dozen who retained their youth, however,
Gerald was enraptured. As he looked from one
of them to the other, each in her turn appeared so
surpassingly lovely that she excelled all the other
women his gaze had ever beheld.... But, no!
Glaum was his benefactor. Glaum at this instant,
in Lichfield, was toiling away at that unfinished
romance about Dom Manuel of Poictesme which by
and by was to make the name of Gerald Musgrave
famous everywhere. It would, therefore, never do to
encourage these so shapely and chromatically meritorious
dears to follow out the dictates of womanly
confidence and generosity to the point where they
could bleat about it. No, to permit them all to deceive
one husband would be an unfriendly and injudicious
pleonasm, Gerald reflected. And Gerald
sighed whole-heartedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seven women had sighed earlier. “What else
is now come to trouble us?” said the wives of the
Sylan when Gerald came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered them, with a great voice: “Ladies,
I am Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and the Preserver,
the Lord of the Third Truth, the Well-beloved
of Heavenly Ones. Yet, I pray you, do not
be unduly alarmed by this revelation! I am not a
ruthless deity, I deal fiercely with none save my misguided
opponents. I, in a word, am he of whom it
was prophesied that I, my dear ladies, or perhaps I
ought to say that he—although, to be sure, it does
not really matter which pronoun a strict grammarian
would prefer, since in any case the meaning is unmistakable
and very sublime,—would at his or at my
appointed season appear, in unexampled and appropriate
splendor, to reign over Antan, riding upon the
silver stallion Kalki.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the wives of Glaum seemed unimpressed.
“Your meaning, sir,” said one of them, “may be
terrible, but certainly it is not plain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This wife had reddish golden hair, uncovered:
she wore a blue gown, so fashioned that it left her
right breast wholly uncovered also; and, doubtless
for some sufficient purpose, she carried an iron
candlestick with seven branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald asked, with indignation tempered by her
good looks: “And do you doubt my divine word? Do
you dispute my Dirghic godhead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another wife answered him, a glorious dark sultry
creature in purple, who wore a semi-circular crown
and had about the upper part of each bare arm two
broad gold bands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said: “Why should we question that? Gods
by the score and by the hundreds, gods in battalions,
have passed through the land of Dersam, going
downward toward Antan, to enter into well-earned
rest after their long labors in this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, so it appears that Antan is the heaven of
all deserving gods, and that I am to rule a celestially
populated kingdom well worthy of me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have not ever been to Antan. We thus know
nothing of its customs. We know only that many
gods have passed us, traveling upon all manner of
steeds as they went down into Antan. Bes rode upon
a cat, and Tlaloc upon a stag, and Siva upon a bull:
we have seen Kali pass upon the back of a tiger:
above our heads Zeus has gone by upon the back of
an eagle, as he traveled abreast with Amen-Ra upon
the back of a very large beetle. We therefore think
it likely enough that you who pass upon this shining
horse are yet another one of these gods. What are
the gods to us, in this our season of unexampled
trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the seven wives fell into a lamentation, and
their complaining was that, since Glaum of the
Haunting Eyes had left them, the sacred mirror reflected
only the person who stood before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is not such the nature of all mirrors?” Gerald
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sir,” replied the wife who carried a bunch of
keys, and who wore that unaccountable tall bifurcated
orange-colored headdress, “but until yesterday
ours was the mirror which showed things as they
ought to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did one discover in it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the old wife spoke. Her head was wrapped
in a white turban; her face had no more color than has
the belly of a fish; and a sprinkling of white hairs, so
long that they had grown into spirals and half-circles,
glittered upon her shaking chin. “To the aged, such
as I have now become, the Mirror of Caer Omn reveals
nothing any more: but to the young, such as we
all were before Glaum left us, it was used to reveal
that which may not be described.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you not place before it some young
person—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, sir, but there is no longer any co-respondent
youth in the mirror!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker was the brown-haired and alluringly
plump wife who wore nothing at all anywhere, and
whose delicious body had been depilated in every
needful place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the seven wives of Glaum of the Haunting
Eyes raised a lament; and now the pallid sharp-nosed
wife who was far gone in pregnancy, and who
wore that maroon-colored headdress shaped like a
cone, began to speak of the young fellows who had
been used to come to them out of the sacred mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke of very handsome, tall, brisk, nimble,
impudent young fellows, that had been always jolly
and buxom and jaunty, and not ever grumpish like
a husband; of over-rash young fellows who must
have their flings, who stuck at nothing, who went to
all lengths, who had a finger in every pie, who kept
the pot a-boiling; of what forward, eager, pushing,
plodding, thwacking, negligent of no corner, business-like,
never-wearying, soul-stirring workmen they
had been at every job they undertook; of what great
plagues they had been, too, without the least bit of
any patience or of any modesty; and of how unreasonably
you missed these sad rapscallions now that
there was no longer any co-respondent youth remaining
in the sacred Mirror of Caer Omn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied: “Your plaint is very moving. I
regard a mirror which begets any such young fellows
as a rather beautiful idea. It is true that I am a
bachelor who therefore object to no reasonable mitigation
of matrimony. But I am also a god, dear
ladies, a god who brings all youth with me here in
this vial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that the last wife spoke. Her hair was flaxen;
her body was everywhere engagingly visible through
her gown, of a transparent soft green tissue; she carried
a small golden-hilted sword. And this wife said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You differ, then, from those other gods who
have passed this way. No youth went with these
gods, who had themselves grown old and tired and
more feeble, and who journeyed toward a resting
from all miracles and away from a world wherein
they were no longer worshipped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I,” said Gerald, “I am a god who is, moreover,
a citizen of the United States of America,
wherein every sort of religion yet flourishes as it can
never do in an effete and sophisticated monarchy.
So do you show me the way to the temple of the
sacred Mirror of Caer Omn!”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>11.<br> <span class='sub-head'>The Glass People</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE seven wives conducted Fair-haired Hoo,
the Helper and the Preserver, to the Temple
of the Mirror. It was the old wife who
now lifted from the mirror a blue veil embroidered
with tiny fig-leaves worked in gold thread.
You saw then that this mirror was splotched and
clouded and mildewed. It reflected sallowly a distorted
and rather speckled Gerald: it glistened with
an unwholesome iridescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and Preserver,
the Lord of the Third Truth, when he had
announced his various titles, with such due ceremony
as befits an exchange of amenities between divine
powers, moistened his finger-tip with one drop of
water from the Churning of the Ocean. Upon the
sacred Mirror of Caer Omn he drew with his finger-tip
the triangle of the male and of the female principle,
so that the one interpenetrated the other: and
he invoked Monachiel, Ruach, Achides, and Degaliel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was never a more inconsequent rejoicing
witnessed anywhere than was made by the seven
wives of Glaum of the Haunting Eyes, now that the
sacred mirror was altered, for these seven ungrateful
scatter-brained women were now singing a sort of
hymn in honor of the charitableness and the vigorous
procreative powers of the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what under the sun has the sun,” said Gerald,
a little flustered, “to do with the not inconsiderable
favor which I have conferred upon this
country? And do you think such anatomical details
as you are singing about quite the proper theme for
an opera?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They replied: “Sir, it is obvious that you are a
sun god, of the clan of Far-darting Helios and Freyr
the Fond Wooer and the Elder Horus and Marduk
of the Bright Glance, all of whom have ridden this
way as they passed down toward Antan. Sir, it is
clear that the Lord of the Third Truth, also, is a
god whose mission it is to awaken warmth and humidity
and a renewal of life in all that he touches—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” Gerald said, “but with my finger!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Just as,” they concluded, “you have done
to this mirror. Therefore, sir, we are praising your
charitableness and your vigorous procreative powers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now I comprehend you! Still, let us, in these
public choral odes, let us adhere strictly to the charitableness!
Those other solar traits I would describe
as far better adapted to chamber music, in some duet
form. Meanwhile, since this somewhat un-American
hymn is intended as a personal tribute, I accept your
really very personal arithmetic in the proper spirit,
dear ladies, as a pious exaggeration. For of course,
just as you say, it does seem fairly obvious I am a
sun god.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Gerald, after all, was now more deeply interested
in that huge mirror than in anything else. He
saw that the mirror which they worshipped in the
land of Dersam was not in any way dreadful. If only
the mirror of Freydis was like this, then every inheritance
which awaited him in his appointed kingdom
might well be pleasant enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For now the Mirror of Caer Omn shone with a
golden clear glowing, and in its depths he viewed
with lively admiration a throng of strange and lovely
beings such as he had not known in Lichfield.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>12.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Confusions of the Golden Travel</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>B</span></span>UT when three huge men beckoned to him,
and Gerald had moved forward, he found,
with wholly tolerant surprise, that this mirror
was in reality a warmish golden mist, through which
he entered into the power of these three giant blacksmiths,
and into the shackles of adamant with which
they bound him fast to a gray, lichen-crusted crag,
the topmost crag above a very wide ravine, among a
desert waste of mountain tops; and he entered, too,
into that noble indignation which now possessed
Gerald utterly. For it was Heaven he was defying,
he who was an apostate god, a god unfrightened by
the animosity of his divine fellows. He had preserved,
somehow,—in ways which he could not very
clearly recall, but of which he stayed wholly proud,—all
men and women from destruction by the harshness
and injustice of Heaven. He only of the gods
had pitied that futile, naked, cowering race which
lived, because of their defencelessness among so
many other stronger animals, in dark and shallow
caverns, like ants in an ant-hill. He had made those
timid, scatter-brained, two-legged animals human: he
had taught them to build houses and boats; to make
and to employ strong knives and far-smiting arrows
against the fangs and claws with which Heaven had
equipped the other animals; and to tame horses and
dogs to serve them in their hunting for food. He
had taught them to write and to figure and to compound
salves and medicines for their hurts, and even
to foresee the future more or less. All arts that were
among the human race had come from Prometheus,
and all these benefits were now preserved for his so
inadequate, dear puppets, through the nineteen books
in which Prometheus had set down the secrets of all
knowledge and all beauty and all contentment,—he
who after he had discovered to mortals so many
inventions had no invention to preserve himself.
Prometheus, in brief, had created and had preserved
men and women, in defiance of Heaven’s fixed will.
For that sacrilege Prometheus atoned, among the
ends of earth, upon this lichen-crusted gray crag. He
suffered for the eternal redemption of mankind, the
first of all poets, of those makers who delight to
shape and to play with puppets, and the first of men’s
Saviors. And his was a splendid martyrdom, for the
winged daughters of old Ocean fluttered everywhere
about him in the golden Scythian air, like wailing seagulls,
and a grief-crazed woman with the horns of
a cow emerging from her disordered yellow hair
paused too to cherish him, and then went toward
the rising place of the sun to endure her allotted
share of Heaven’s injustice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he who was the first of poets burst Heaven’s
shackles like packthread, ridding himself of all ties
save the little red band which yet clung about one
finger, and rising, passed to his throne between the
bronze lions which guarded each of its six steps, and
so sat beneath a golden disk. All wisdom now belonged
to the rebel against Heaven, and his was all
earthly power: the fame of the fine poetry and the
comeliness and the grandeur of Solomon was known
in Assyria and Yemen, in both Egypts and in Persepolis,
in Karnak and in Chalcedon, and among all
the isles of the Mediterranean. He sported with genii
and with monsters of the air and of the waters;
the Elementals served King Solomon when he began
to build, as a bribe to Heaven, a superb temple which
was engraved and carved and inlaid everywhere with
cherubim and lions and pineapples and oxen and the
two triangles. There was no power like Solomon’s:
his ships returned to him three times each year with
the tribute of Nineveh and Tyre and Parvaam and
Mesopotamia and Katuar; the kings of all the world
were the servants of King Solomon: the spirits of
fire and the lords of the air brought tribute to him,
too, from behind the Pleiades. His temple now was
half completed. But upon his ring finger stayed always
the band of blood-colored asteria upon which
was written, “All things pass away.” These glittering
and soft and sweet-smelling things about him,
as he knew always, were only loans which by and by
would be taken away from him by Heaven. He
turned from these transient things to drunkenness
and to the embraces of women, he hunted forgetfulness
upon the breasts of nine hundred women, he
quested after oblivion between the thighs of the most
beautiful women of Judea and Israel, of Moab and
of Ammon and of Bactria, of Baalbec and of Babylon:
he turned to wantoning with boys and with
beasts and with bodies of the dead. These madnesses
enraptured the flesh of Solomon, but always the undrugged
vision of his mind regarded the fixed will
of Heaven, “These things shall pass away.” The
temple which he had been building lacked now only
one log to be completed. He cast that gray and
lichen-crusted cedar log into the Pool of Bethesda:
it sank as though it had been a stone: and Solomon
bade his Israelites set fire to the temple which all
these years he had been building as a bribe to
Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the temple burned, it became more than
a temple, for not only the flanks of Mt. Moriah were
ablaze, a whole city was burning there, and its name
was Ilion. He aided in the pillaging of it: the golden
armor of Achilles fell to his share. In such heroic
gear, he, like a fox hidden in a slain lion’s skin, took
ship to Ismaurus, which city he treacherously laid
waste and robbed: thence he passed to the land of the
Lotophagi, where he viewed with mildly curious, cool
scorn the men who fed upon oblivion. He was captured
by a very bad-smelling, one-eyed giant, from
whom he through his wiles escaped. There was no
one anywhere more quick in wiles than was Odysseus,
Laertes’ son. He toiled unhurt through a nightmare
of pitfalls and buffetings, among never-tranquil seas,
outwitting the murderous Laestrigonians, and hoodwinking
Circe and the feathery-legged Sirens and
fond Calypso: he evaded the man-eating ogress with
six heads: he passed among the fluttering, gray,
squeaking dead, and got the better of Hades’ sullen
overlords and ugly spectres, through his unfailing
wiliness,—he who was still a poet, making the supreme
poem of each man’s journeying through an
everywhere inimical and betraying world, he who was
pursued by the wrath of Heaven which Poseidon
had stirred up against Odysseus. But always the wiles
of much-enduring Odysseus evaded the full force
of Heaven’s buffetings, so that in the end he won
home to Ithaca and to his meritorious wife; and
then, when the suitors of Penelope had been killed,
he went, as dead Tiresias had commanded, into a
mountainous country carrying upon his shoulder an
oar, and leading a tethered ram, for it was yet necessary
to placate Heaven. Beyond Epirus, among the
high hills of the Thesproteans, he sat the oar upright
in the stony ground, and turning toward the ram
which he now meant to sacrifice to Poseidon, he
found Heaven’s amiability to remain unpurchased,
because the offering of Odysseus, who was a rebel
against Heaven’s will to destroy him, had been refused,
and the ram had vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in his hand was still the rope with which he
had led this ram, and in his other hand was a bag
containing silver money, and in his heart, now that
he had again turned northerly, to find in place of the
oar an elder-tree in flower, now in his heart was the
knowledge that no man could travel beyond him in
hopelessness and in infamy. He remembered all that
he had put away, all which he had denied and betrayed,
all the kindly wonders which he had witnessed
between Galilee and Jerusalem, where the
carpenters of the Sanhedrin were now fashioning,
from a great lichen-crusted cedar log found floating
in the Pool of Bethesda, that cross which would be
set up to-morrow morning upon Mt. Calvary. Then
Judas flung down the accursed silver and the rope
with which he had come hither to destroy himself,
because an infamy so complete as his must first be
expressed with fitting words. It was a supreme infamy,
it was man’s masterpiece in the way of iniquity,
it was the reply of a very fine poet to Heaven’s proffered
truce after so many æons of tormenting men
causelessly: it was a thing not to be spoken of but
sung. He heaped great sheets of lead upon his chest,
he slit the cord beneath his tongue, he tormented
himself with clysters and with purges and in all other
needful ways, so that his voice might be at its most
effective when he sang toward Heaven about his
infamy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he sang of his offence against Heaven,
he likened his hatefulness to that of very horrible
offenders in yet elder times, he compared his sin to
that of Œdipus who sinned inexpiably with his
mother, and to that of Orestes whom Furies pursued
forever because he had murdered his mother.
But it was not of any Jocasta or of any Clytemnestra
he was thinking, rather it was of his own mother, of
that imperious, so beautiful Agrippina whom he had
feared and had loved with a greater passion than
anyone ought to arouse in an emperor, and whom he
had murdered. Nothing could put Agrippina out of
his thoughts. It availed no whit that he was lord of
all known lands, and the owner of the one house in
the world fit for so fine a poet to live in, a house
entirely overlaid with gold and adorned everywhere
with jewels and with mother of pearl, a house that
quite dwarfed the tawdry little Oriental hovel which
Solomon had builded as a bribe to Heaven, because
this was a house so rich and ample that it had three-storied
porticos a mile in length, and displayed upon
its front portico not any such trumpery as an Ark
of the Covenant but a colossal statue of that Nero
Claudius Cæsar who was the supreme poet the world
had ever known. Yet nothing could put Agrippina
out of Nero’s thoughts. From the satiating of no
lust, howsoever delicate or brutal, and from the
committing of no enormity, and from the loveliness
of none of his poems, could he get happiness and
real peace of mind. He hungered only for Agrippina,
he wanted back her detested scoldings and intermeddlings,
he reviled the will of Heaven which
had thwarted the desires of a fine poet by making
this so beautiful, proud woman his mother, and he
practised those magical rites which would summon
Agrippina from the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she returned to him, incredibly beautiful,
and pale and proud, and quite naked, just as he
had last seen her when his sword had ripped open
this woman’s belly so that he might see the womb in
which he had once lain, then the divine Augusta drew
him implacably downward among the dead, and so
into the corridors of a hollow mountain. This place
was thronged with all high-hearted worshippers of
the frightening, discrowned, imperious, so beautiful
woman who had drawn him thither resistlessly, and
in this Hörselberg he lived in continued splendor
and in a more dear lewdness, and he still made songs,
only now it was as Tannhäuser that the damned acclaimed
him as supreme among poets. But Heaven
would not let him rest even among these folk who
had put away all thought of Heaven. Heaven troubled
Tannhäuser with doubts, with premonitions,
even with repentance. Heaven with such instruments
lured this fine poet from the scented Hörselberg into
a bleak snow-wrapped world: and presently he shivered
too under the cold wrath of Pope Urban, bells
rang, a great book was cast down upon the pavement
of white and blue slabs, and the candles were being
snuffed out, as the now formally excommunicated
poet fled westerly from Rome pursued by the ever-present
malignity of Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from afar he saw the sapless dry rod break
miraculously into blossom, and he saw the messengers
of a frightened Bishop of Rome (with whom
also Heaven was having its malicious sport) riding
everywhither in search of him, bearing Heaven’s pardon
to the sinner whom they could not find. For the
poet sat snug in a thieves’ kitchen, regaling himself
with its sour but very potent wines and with its
frank, light-fingered girls. Yet a gibbet stood uncomfortably
near to the place: upon bright days the
shadow of this gallows fell across the threshold of
the room in which they rather squalidly made merry.
Death seemed to wait always within arm’s reach,
pilfering all, with fingers more light and nimble than
those which a girl runs furtively through the pockets
of the put-by clothing of her client in amour. Death
nipped the throats of ragged poor fellows high in
the air yonder, and death very lightly drew out of
the sun’s light and made at one with Charlemagne
all the proud kings of Aragon and Cyprus and Bohemia,
and death casually tossed aside the tender
sweet flesh which had been as white as the snows
of last winter, and was as little regarded now, of
such famous tits as Héloïse and Thaïs and Queen
Bertha Broadfoot. Time was a wind which carried
all away. Time was preparing by and by (still at the
instigation of ruthless Heaven) to make an end even
to François Villon, who was still so fine a poet, for
all that time had made of him a wine-soaked, rickety,
hairless, lice-ridden and diseased sneakthief whose
food was paid for by the professional earnings of a
stale and flatulent harlot. For time ruined all: time
was man’s eternal strong ravager, time was the flail
with which Heaven pursued all men whom Heaven
had not yet destroyed, ruthlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But time might yet be confounded: and it was
about that task he set. For Mephistophilus had allotted
him twenty-four years of wholly untrammeled
living, and into that period might be heaped the
spoilage of centuries. He took unto himself eagle’s
wings and strove to fathom all the causes of the
misery which was upon earth and of the enviousness
of Heaven. That which time had destroyed, Johan
Faustus brought back into being: he was a poet who
worked in necromancy, his puppets were the most
admirable and lovely of the dead. Presently he was
restoring through art magic even those lost nineteen
books in which were the secrets of all beauty and all
knowledge and all contentment, the secrets for which
Prometheus had paid. But the professors at the university
would have nothing to do with these nineteen
books. It was feared that into these books restored
by the devil’s aid, the devil might slily have
inserted something pernicious: and besides, the professors
said, there were already enough books from
which the students could learn Greek and Hebrew
and Latin. So they let perish again all those secrets
of beauty and knowledge and contentment which the
world had long lost. Now Johan Faustus laughed at
the ineradicable folly with which Heaven had smitten
all men, a folly against which the clear-sighted
poet fought in vain. But Johan Faustus at least was
wise, and there had never been any other beauty like
this which now stood before him within arm’s reach
(as surely as did death), now that with a yet stronger
conjuration he had wrested from all-devouring time
even the beauty of Argive Helen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he would have touched the Swan’s
daughter, the delight of gods and men, she vanished,
precisely as a touched bubble is shattered into innumerable
sparkling bits, and over three thousand
of them he pursued and captured in all quarters of
the earth, for, as he said of himself, Don Juan Tenorio
had the heart of a poet, which is big enough to
be in love with the whole world, and like Alexander
he could but wish for other spheres to which he might
extend his conquests, and each one of these sparkling
bits of womanhood glittered with something of that
lost Helen’s loveliness, yet, howsoever various and
resistless were their charms, and howsoever gaily he
pursued them, singing ever-new songs, and swaggeringly
gallant, in his fair, curly wig and his gold-laced
coat adorned with flame-colored ribbons, yet he, the
eternal pursuer, was in turn pursued by the malevolence
of Heaven, in, as it seemed, the shape of an
avenging horseman who drew ever nearer unhurriedly,
until at last the clash of rapiers and the
pleasant strumming of mandolins were not any
longer to be heard in that golden and oleander-scented
twilight,—because of those ponderous, unhurried
hoofbeats, which had made every other noise
inaudible,—and until at last he perceived that both
the rider and the steed were of moving stone, of an
unforgotten stone which was gray and lichen-crusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when fearlessly he encountered the overtowering
statue, and had grasped the horse about
its round cold neck, he saw that the stone rider was
lifeless, and was but the dumb and staring effigy of
a big man in armor which was inset with tinsel and
with bits of colored glass. It was the bungled copy
and the parody of a magnanimous, great-hearted
dream that he was grasping, and yet it was a part
of him, who had been a poet once, but was now a
battered old pawnbroker, for in some way, as he incommunicably
knew, this parodied and not ever comprehended
Redeemer and he were blended, and they
were, somehow, laboring in unison to serve a shared
purpose. He derided and he came too near to a mystery
which he distrusted, and which yet (without his
preference having been consulted in the affair) remained
a part of him, as it was a part of all poets,
even of a cashiered poet, and a part very vitally
necessary to the existence of a Jurgen. A Jurgen had
best not meddle with such matters one half-second
sooner than that dimly foreseen, inevitable need
arose for a Jurgen also to be utilized in the service
of this mystery, without having his preference in the
affair consulted. The aging pawnbroker was a little
afraid. He climbed gingerly down from the tall pedestal
of Manuel the Redeemer, he descended from
that ambiguous tomb upon which he was trampling,
he stepped rather hastily backward from that carved
fragment of the crag of Prometheus. He stepped
backward, treading beyond the confines of the golden
mirror which was worshipped at Caer Omn; and he
was thus released from its magic.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>13.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Colophon of a God</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW before him the mirror still glowed
goldenly, and now a hunchback held out
both his hands toward Gerald, whom he
was trying to allure into the form and mind of this
sardonic, cracker-jawed, sly knave who had such melancholy
eyes. Gerald was much tempted to become
this Punch, and to relive for a little the rascal’s
defiant and ever-restless life. And then too, behind
Punch waited tall Merlin, crowned with mistletoe,
he that created all chivalry, and that, being himself
the great fiend’s son, first taught men how to live
as became the children of God. It would be quite
entertaining to enter into Merlin’s dark heart. Moreover,
to the other hand of Punch, stood a glittering
suave gentleman with a blue beard, in whose uxoricides
it might be vastly interesting to share....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Gerald, facing these three rather beautiful
ideas, was of two minds. “For I am a god, with a
throne awaiting me in Antan, where all the other
gods will be my lackeys,—and, for that matter, with
no doubt a whole cosmos of my own twirling and
burning to unheeded clinkers somewhere in space,
which I ought at this moment to be looking after and
embellishing. And in this particular small world
which I am quitting, the powers of Heaven do quite
honestly seem—when you look at them from a perhaps
biassed standpoint, that is,—and only to a
certain extent, of course,—and if you are so ill-advised
as to consider matters in a pessimistic, morbid,
wholly un-American way—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald paused. He smilingly shook his red head.
“No. It is far better for us gods not to criticize the
handiwork of one another. So I shall without one
word of reproof permit my fellows to play as they
like with this planet called Earth. I shall of course,
very probably, make new planets a bit more conformable
to my personal fancy. But I shall say nothing
about the planet I am now quitting at all likely to
hurt anybody’s feelings. No: I shall, rather, rely
upon the appealing eloquence of a dignified silence
reinforced by a decisive departure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said also: “As for this mirror which
is worshipped in the land of Dersam, it pleases me
as a toy. But I who am a Savior and a sun god with
nine such very fine exploits behind me, in the way of
swimming and of decimating devils, and of restoring
warmth and making moons, and of really remarkable
broad-mindedness as to what particular
animal I may happen to look like,—I, the Helper
and the Preserver, who am called to reign over the
goal of all the gods of men,—why, I must necessarily
lose by exchanging such a tremendous destiny
for anything to be found in this mirror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “No. I must never forget that,
whether I am a Savior or a sun deity, or whether
I am habitually used to discharge both functions, I
in any case remain Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and
Preserver, the Lord of the Third Truth, and so on.
I am a most notable figure, of some sort or another
sort, in Dirghic mythology. I am the appointed rider
of the silver stallion. I am destined to inherit from
the Master Philologist the great and best words of
magic, and after that poor hospitable fellow’s downfall
to reign in his stead over the place beyond good
and evil which is the goal of all the gods of men and
the reward of their meritorious exertions. I cannot
forsake such a majestic destiny in order to play with
the droll and pretty figures that move about in the
depths of this mirror. And whether or not this is a
mirror which I may require hereafter, when I have
come into my kingdom and have resumed my exalted
divine estate in my appropriate mythology, is a matter
which I shall settle in due time who have all
eternity wherein to do whatever I may prefer.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>14.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Evarvan of the Mirror</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HEN Gerald perceived that the wives of
Glaum were not yet through with their
wonder-workings, for these seven women
were now about a ceremony which they called Asvamedha.
They led into the temple a brown horse. Before
the mirror they struck down this horse with
pole-axes. The tail was cut off by the flaxen-haired
wife in green, and the naked wife carried it away,
Gerald did not know whither. The horse’s head also
was severed from the body, by that wife who was
with child; the head was then adorned with a chaplet
made of small loaves of bread. This head was afterward
impaled upon a stake and thus was set upright
before the mirror, but not facing it. Then the six
wives of Glaum who yet remained in the temple
mixed the blood of the horse with the blood of unborn
calves; they turned the stake: and they showed
Gerald what he must do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had obeyed, and when they had all
invoked Evarvan, then the golden glowing of the
sacred mirror was turned into a paler haze like that
of moonshine. Out of this silvery mistiness came a
crowned woman. She was clothed in white, and about
her head shone an aureole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald was enraptured. For this Evarvan
of the Mirror was so surpassingly lovely that she
excelled all the other women his gaze had ever beheld.
Yet somehow it was not the coloring nor the
placing of her features that he was noting. Rather,
he was observing himself and the thing which was
happening to this careful, this well-poised, fastidious,
parched, rather pitiable Gerald whom for so many
years he had known. The creature had not for a
great while, not since, indeed, the days of his first
insanity about Evelyn, been visited by any real emotion:
now, momentarily at least, he was ablaze: he
was caught perhaps: and it was this imminent personal
peril that Gerald was noting, aloofly, with a
drugged sense of derisory exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this Gerald, as it seemed to him, had known
quite well, a great while ago, before his lips had
touched for pastime’s sake the lips of any woman
anywhere, that this woman who, it seemed, was
called Evarvan, existed in some place, and waited
for him, and would by and by be found. That very
important fact, which a boy had known, a thriftless,
very silly young man had let slip out of mind.
Throughout all the twenty-eight years of his living,
it seemed to Gerald, this Evarvan had been the true
and perfect love of his heart’s core.... To the
extreme romanticism of this phrase he conceded a
smile: that he should have concocted a phrase so
abominable showed him just now to be neither fastidious
nor well poised.... Nevertheless, here was
the woman whose existence he, even in Lichfield,
had always dimly divined, and of whom—he had
it now,—of whom Evelyn Townsend had been a
parodying shadow in human flesh. The likeness had
been just sufficient to get him into a great deal of
trouble. He saw that likeness now, quite plainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this woman too is going to get me into
trouble, I very much fear. For all my being cries out
to her. Eh, Gerald, one needs caution here, my lad,
you who find trouble uncongenial!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evarvan spoke. And she was speaking, oddly
enough, as it seemed to him, of that Evelyn who went
about Lichfield immured in the body which was a
poor copy of Evarvan’s body. Yet Gerald was listening
hardly at all. He did not like the strong, insane
and over-youthful emotions which this woman
roused in him. They endangered his welfare. For this
woman was awakening in him those old, unforgotten
fervors which he had once felt for Evelyn Townsend,
and which had betrayed him into the horrid bondage
of an illicit love-affair. This Evarvan was ensnaring
him, he knew, into the insanities appropriate to youth
and inexperience: and such nonsense had to be controlled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was half dazedly Gerald protested that—quite
apart from the claims of his divine duties as a
Savior and a sun god, and apart too from the obligations
he was under to ascend the throne of Antan,—he
could no longer endure the stupidities and the
fretfulness and the jealousies of the Evelyn who had
made adultery wholly unendurable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she were but a bit like you, ma’am,” Gerald
gallantly remarked,—with somewhat increasing
composure now that this woman reminded him the
more closely that he observed her yet more and more
of Evelyn,—“the case would be different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I,” said Evarvan of the Mirror, “will remain
with you always, if you indeed desire to become
my lover. For there is a way, Gerald, there is
for you through my mirror’s aid an open way to contentment.
You shall know an untruth, and that untruth
will make you free: the doings of the world,
and all the bustling that is made by merchants and
by warriors and by well-thought-of persons talking
about important matters, will then run by you like a
little stream of shallow, bickering waters: and you
will heed none of these things, but only that loveliness
which all youth desires and no man ever finds
save through my mirror’s aid. You will live among
bright shadows very futilely: yes: but you will be
happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied hoarsely: “I desire only you. I
cannot think of thrones, nor of any gods, now that
you stand here within arm’s reach. All my life-long
I have desired you, as I know now, my dearest,
throughout the dreary while of over-much playing
and laughter that I have lived in ever-dwindling
faith I would yet win to you by and by. But now I
am again as Johan Faustus,—or, rather, I am as
Jurgen in that other old story, when he had come at
last to Helen, the delight of gods and men: only I
am more favored than was Jurgen, for my Helen
speaks....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and I speak for your own good, my darling,
for there is a condition to be fulfilled before I may
trust you and may give you all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald answered: “No, Evelyn, not to-night—But
indeed I entreat your pardon, my dear. My mind
must have been wandering. Yes, yes! as I was saying,
the difference is that Helen speaks!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your own good, my dearest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; you speak, naturally, of a condition for my
own good, just as Glaum hinted that so many more
or less friendly persons would be doing in these
parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak, though, of a very easy condition. You
must yourself perform a tiny Asvamedha; and you
must immolate before my mirror, not any really valuable
horse, of course, nor even a good-looking horse,
but only that hideous and wholly worthless horse
which you have brought with you into the land of
Dersam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “And that is a small price to
pay for the attainment of the one thing which my
heart quite earnestly desires, is it not? For all my
life I have hungered, as I believe that all poets
hunger, for that unflawed beauty, seemingly not ever
to be found upon this earth, which now stands revealed
in the form of a woman, and which now
speaks to me with the voice of a woman—oh, quite
with the voice of a woman!—and speaks, too, for
my own good. Yes, it is a small price, such as any
boy of nineteen or thereabouts would pay gladly.
For I must tell you, who are the delight of gods
and—well! of adolescent boys, at least, in every
quarter of the world,—that all this very strongly
reminds me of that first sonnet which I made about
you when I was a boy of nineteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evarvan did not wholly conceal her uneasiness
over the prospect of hearing this sonnet. But there
was none the less in her voice a tenderness almost
motherly now that she asked of Gerald, “And
did you make verses, then, about me, dear, so
early?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To prove it,” Gerald replied, “I will now recite
to you that identical sonnet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his voice was so shaken with emotion that,
when he had completed the octave, he paused, because
it was never within Gerald’s power to resist
the beauty of a sublime thought when it was thus
adequately expressed in flawless verse. So for an instant
he stayed silent. He caught up the lovely hands
of Evarvan of the Mirror, and he pressed them to
his trembling lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this beguiling bright dream was now become
a snare to delay him in journeying onward to his
appointed kingdom, and to betray him again into
bondage to the rather beautiful ideas and tinsel
notions of youth. Presently he would be seeing no
more of this traitorous dream woman, who was preparing
to trust him and to give him all, and who
none the less was more lovely and more dear than
any real thing anywhere. Afterward he would regret
her, he knew: always he would regret Evarvan,
among whatsoever delights they were which awaited
Gerald in his appointed kingdom. Nevertheless, this
dream was an impediment in the way of a Savior
and a sun deity, with whose appropriate functions
this dream was interfering: and the most painful
duty which confronted Gerald was not precisely to
be discourteous to a lady, but to discourage sacrilege.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dismissing these cursory reflections, Gerald
sighed: and he continued the reciting of his sonnet
with an air of lofty resignation intermingled with a
gustatory approval of really good verse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said Evarvan of the Mirror, when he
had ended, “is a very beautiful sonnet, and I am
proud to have inspired it. But we were talking about
something else, I have quite forgotten what—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” Gerald said, “have not forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, now I do remember! We were talking
about the lucky chance afforded you to get rid of that
dreadful horse of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald looked for one instant at the most lovely
of all the illusions he had found in the Mirror of
Caer Omn. Then he began to recite the multiplication
tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You saw that she was frightened. She said, “Oh,
and I trusted you! I gave you all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bleated now; her beauty was dimmed: and
she seemed just the Evelyn Townsend who had pestered
Gerald beyond any reasonable endurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerald, howsoever heavy was the heart of
Gerald who quite honestly objected to being troubled
by anything, went on inexorably to exorcise Evarvan
with the old runes of common-sense. He spoke of
the elephant that is the largest of beasts, and of the
very dissimilar household economy practised by a
King of Israel and by Elijah the Tishbite, and of the
straight line that is the shortest distance between
two points; and the old magic was potent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before his eyes Evarvan of the Mirror was
changed. Of the degradation which was put upon
her, it suffices to report that this lovely lady went
backward in the course of every mortal woman’s
living. She passed from girlhood into a lank-legged
childhood, and thence into drooling and feebly
puking infancy, and after that into the shapes she
had worn in her mother’s womb. In the end there
remained of the most dear illusion which Gerald
had found in the Mirror of Caer Omn only two pink
figures in the form of a soft throbbing egg and of
a creature like a tadpole darting lustfully about it:
and these melted back into the moonshine of the
Sacred Mirror of Caer Omn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was that all. The wives of Glaum and the
Temple of the Mirror and all that was about Gerald
began to waver. All the material things about him
showed now like paintings on a gauze curtain which
was moving and crinkling in a very gentle breeze.
The shaping of the six wives became longer and
more attenuated: they were shaped like the shadows
of women in a fine sunset. These so prettily tinted
shadows strained toward the mirror and entered it
precisely as you may see smoke drift toward and
out of an opened window. Then all the temple followed
them collapsingly, as if colored waters were
running into a hole. The mirror swallowed all. Caer
Omn was gone: the land of Dersam was a ruined
land without inhabitants. Afterward the pale glass
blinked seven times like summer lightning, and the
mirror was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald stood alone in a cedar-shadowed way. He
was weeping quite unaffectedly. His very deepest
poetic sensibilities had been touched by the rather
beautiful idea that he had loved this woman all his
life-long, and that now he had lost her forever: but
a little way behind Gerald the silver stallion stayed
unimmolated, and grazed placidly.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>G</span></span>ERALD passed on, riding upon the stallion
Kalki, down a valley of cedar-trees, into
the realm of Tenjo of the Long Nose. This
was the land of Lytreia, they told him. But, here too,
dejection overbrooded all, and the atmosphere was
elegiac, for people everywhere were lamenting that
vigor and resiliency and liveliness had gone out
of their noses, so that no man in Lytreia was able to
sneeze or to employ his nose in any other normal
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, suppose you take me to this king of
yours,” said Gerald, “for it may be I can re-awaken
hereabouts all the lost joys of influenza.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who shall we say to him has come into Lytreia,
red-headed and riding upon the back of this
huge and sparkling horse with the splendid nose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will say to your king that this land is
honored by a visit from Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper
and Preserver, the Lord of the Third Truth, the
Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones, as he passes toward
his appointed kingdom in Antan, riding in
very terrible estate upon the back of his famous
silver stallion Kalki, a beast which, strictly speaking,
has no nose, but only nostrils at the tip of his long,
noble head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They also seemed unimpressed. “No god is
of terrible estate except the Holy Nose of Lytreia;
nor do we concede the existence of any kingdom not
his. Nevertheless, you may come with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word,” thought Gerald, “but in these
parts the people pay very inadequate homage to us
gods and are little better than heretics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he went with these over-sceptical persons
quietly to their King Tenjo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Tenjo received the Well-beloved of Heavenly
Ones more affably. First, though, the grave,
white-bearded King shared with the visiting god a
quite excellent dinner, which was handsomely served
to them by ten pages in ermine and a seneschal in
vermilion silk: not until dinner was over, and the
two sat drinking their spiced wine out of gold goblets,
would the King talk about his troubles. Then
Tenjo complained that his nose was fallen and
flabby. It was no longer worshipful. That was in all
ways deplorable, said the King, refilling his goblet,
inasmuch as his people worshipped a nose, and could
respect no male creature who had not a large and
high-standing and robust and succulent nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald was a little puzzled, because this seemed
to him a queer sort of calamity to be befalling anybody,
unless it was caused by the magic of the wu.
But Gerald made no comment. He asked only how
this sad state of affairs had come about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was told that all the youth and vigor had been
taken out of the Holy Nose of Lytreia, and out of
Tenjo’s nose, and out of the nose of every man in
the kingdom, by the blighting magic of a sorceress
who had lately established her residence in the tomb
of King Peter the Builder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is there,” said Tenjo, “the veiled Mirror of
the Two Truths is hidden: but not even of that does
this sorceress seem afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor, for that matter, am I: for I am Lord of
the Third Truth. Well, it is fairly evident this
woman is a wu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be right. I confess that dreadful possibility
had not ever occurred to me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only we gods are omniscient, my dear Tenjo,”
said Gerald, kindlily. “So there is no need for any
mere king to be ashamed of his human blindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Because, as I must tell you, before this
minute I had not ever heard of a wu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been lucky. The less one hears of such
creatures, the better for everybody. So, how is this
woman called?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is called Evaine,” said Tenjo; “and she is
called also the Lady of Peter’s Tomb, now that she
has taken possession of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald finished his fourth goblet, and Gerald
hiccoughed, and Gerald said: “Your case, my
dear fellow, while perplexing, is not wholly desperate.
For I bring youth with me, and I will renovate
your withered noses. I am competent to deal with
any wu. I give you, in fact, my divine word that
you shall be rid of this wu. Yes, Lytreia shall be
rid of her, even though it is necessary that to
undo her hoodoo I do with due to-do woo the wu,
too—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you be so kind,” said Tenjo, looking
troubled, “as to repeat that, rather more slowly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald obliged him, and continued: “Yes, I assure
you, upon the most sacred oath of our Dirghic
heaven,—known only to the gods, my dear fellow,
so that you will, I trust, pardon my not repeating it,—that
I will subject this wu and this mirror also to
my divine inspection—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but I must tell you,” said Tenjo, seeming yet
more troubled, “that the man who looks into that
mirror straightway finds himself transformed into
two stones. For that reason it is hidden away in
Peter’s Tomb, and it is kept veiled, and of course
no man has ever dared go near it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How, then, did this mirror ever manage to
change anybody into two stones if nobody ever dared
go near it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, but the mirror was compelled to change
them into two stones because that was the law. It
was not at all the mirror’s fault. Surely, you who
are a god and are omniscient, and who are now
nearly drunk enough to see everything double, can
see that much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far as your explanation goes, I can see the
mirror’s blamelessness in the face of an obdurate
physical law. Nor does any god object to a physical
law which concerns other people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they kept away from the mirror because
they knew about this law. Surely, that too was
natural?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a way, yes. But how could they be certain
about this law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could they help it, how could anybody be
ignorant of one of our very oldest and most famous
laws, which comes down to us, indeed, from sources
so august and venerable that they antedate all history?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then, who enacted this law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know, when, as I was just telling
you, this law is older than any recorded history?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in a thousand pounds of law there is not an
ounce of pleasure, and there are entirely too many
laws,” said Gerald, shaking his red head above his
golden goblet rather despondently. “There is common,
statutory, international, maritime, ecclesiastical,
and martial law. There is the law of averages,
the Salic law, and Grimm’s law of the permutations
of consonants. There is Jewish sacred law; there
is prize law; there is the law of gravity; there is
John Law, who first developed the natural wealth
of the Mississippi, and William Law, who was a
great mystic. There are, in logic, the laws of
thought, just as in astronomy and physics and political
economy there are, severally, the well-known
laws of Kepler and Prevost and Gresham. In fine,
there are laws everywhere, and they are very often
a nuisance. He that goes to law loses time and money
and rest and friends. Law is a lottery, law is a bottomless
pit, law is an ass which slaps his tail in every
man’s face. So it very well may be, my dear fellow,
that in a world so legally overstocked this law of
yours is superfluous, and therefore wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Tenjo was not convinced by Gerald’s relentless
logic. Tenjo said only:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not any more know what you are talking
about than you do. But I do know that”—here
Tenjo hiccoughed, with judicial graveness,—“that
it does not alter the principle of the thing. So this
mirror will continue to transform into two stones
all men who look into it, although I cannot see how
it matters the worth of one box of matches in hell,
because so long as the law is such, no man will ever
look into this mirror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, do you but answer me this very simple question!
What if some intelligent, unsuperstitious person
were to look into this mirror,—and were to
come back not changed into stone, and not hurt in
any way,—would that not prove to you the insanity
of this law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it would not! That would only prove
the man was a liar. The plain fact of his not being
changed into two stones would be legal proof in any
of our courts or in any law-respecting place anywhere
that he had not ever looked into the Mirror
of the Two Truths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well!” said Gerald. “No, thank you,
my dear fellow, not another drop! Let us go to the
temple! And let us each lean upon the other’s arm,
for your most excellent wine does not seem to have
clarified anything exactly.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>16.<br> <span class='sub-head'>The Holy Nose of Lytreia</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW, when the grave, white-bearded King
and the red-headed god had come to the
Temple of the Holy Nose, they entered it
arm in arm, followed by the King’s court. And when
they approached the adytum, the head priestess
came toward them exhibiting a cteis, or large copper
comb, which she offered to Tenjo. The King accepted
it, he parted her hair in the middle, and he
spoke the Word of Entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said Tenjo: “I enter, proud and erect. I take my
fill of delight imperiously, irrationally, and none
punishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head priestess replied, “Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tenjo said then, “But in three months, and in
three months, and in three more months, the avenger
comes forth, and mocks me by being as I am, and by
being foredoomed to do as I have done, inevitably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ceremony being discharged, they all entered
the adytum, and then the three priestesses led Gerald
toward the collapsed and shrivelled idol which
was in the adytum. And Gerald whistled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—For do you call this,” said Gerald, “a
nose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” replied the priestesses, “we do. As, likewise,
do all other well-conducted persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, I would call it,” said Gerald, whose naturally
fine color was now perceptibly heightened by
Tenjo’s excellent wine, “another member.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such, sir,” they answered him, “is not our custom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless,” said Gerald, waggling very
gravely his red head, “nevertheless, it is written in
the scriptures of the Protestant Episcopal church
that, even as great ships are turned about in the
sea’s roaring main with a very small helm, even so
is every man guided in the main by a small member—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “Yet, sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this member is not well spoken of by the
Apostolic Fathers. This member has ruined virgins:
its conquests are stained with blood: it has caused
the widow to regret: it has deceived the wisest and
most elderly of men. It is, in fine, a member whose
blushing hue is wholly proper to its iniquitous history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They replied, “Still, sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is an over proud and wild member. Most
justly is it written that every kind of beasts and of
birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is to
be tamed, and has been tamed, by human kind; but
that this member can no man tame; for it is an unruly
member, seeking ruthlessly its prey; a rebellious
member, prominent in uprisings; a member very
often full of deadly poison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said, “None the less, sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I deduce that this member here represented is
not worshipful. I deduce that it is not well for you
of Lytreia to worship this shrivelled image of a
tongue, for all that you call it a nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir, while there is much piousness and
erudition in what you say, you must understand that
the word ‘nose’ is a word with connotations and
with a reputed correspondence in anatomy—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not at all understand that saying, and so I
cannot quite see your point of view. I merely know
that, in consonance with the words of St. James the
Just, and according to the scriptures of the Protestant
Episcopal church, this member is a tongue.
And I admit that this tongue, which your heathenish
upbringing induces you to call a nose, is in a
peculiarly bad way. But the divine word of Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord of
the Third Truth, has been pledged to help and to
preserve this idol. So we will see what can be done
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald moistened his finger-tip with a drop
of the water from the Churning of the Ocean. As
the Lady of the First Water-Gap had done to Gerald’s
forehead, so Gerald did to the shrivelled idol
of Lytreia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was changed. Its limpness departed; its coloring
quickened; corded large blue veins, very intricately
forked and branched, arose about its now
glowing surface, which revealed also many tiny veins
that were brightly red and astonishingly tortuous.
It became enormous and high-standing and robust
and succulent. It throbbed and jerked. It was hot
to the touch: and the roughened cartilage of its
erect tip-end now glistened with imperial purple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And everywhere at that same instant the magic
of Evaine was lifted from Lytreia, and the nose of
every man regained its proper proportions and
vigor. Young couples to the right hand and to the
left could be seen withdrawing to sneeze in private:
the girls were already producing their handkerchiefs.
And the three priestesses began to bathe the
rejuvenated idol with refreshing water: they
wreathed it with leaves of the Indian wood-apple;
they placed before it flowers and incense and sweetmeats.
Meanwhile they chaunted a contented song
in honor of the Holy Nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tenjo and all the older lords and dowagers of
Tenjo’s court had kneeled in worship. Gerald only
remained standing as arrogantly erect as was the
idol which people worshipped in Lytreia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I honor in a civil way,” said Gerald, “the spirit
of this tongue—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this,” said Tenjo the King, now speaking
almost peevishly, “is not a tongue. It is the Holy
Nose of Lytreia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not be flying, my dear fellow, upon the
wings of bad temper, into the face of scripture
and of logic! In a civil way, I repeat, I honor this
member. I personally am rather fond of talking.
Nevertheless, as being myself a member of the Protestant
Episcopal church, and as being also a self-respecting
member of the Dirghic mythology, I must
decline to worship this so restive and inflammable
member of any man’s body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tenjo at that got up from off his knees. He came
toward Gerald: and the white-bearded, grave King
then spoke with rather less of peevishness than of
compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will regret such sayings. For that also is a
law of Lytreia. However, do you now ask what you
will for the vigor which you have restored to our
noses, and we will gladly pay that price. Yet for the
blasphemies which you have uttered in this temple
the spirit of the Holy Nose will by and by be asking a
price: and that price nor you nor any other lad will
ever pay gladly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied, “For the renovation of your
noses, and as a propitiatory trap for the doomed
wu in Peter’s Tomb, you will pay me the price of
one black rooster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what,” asked Tenjo, “is a rooster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, a rooster is the herald of the dawn, it is
the father of an omelet, it is the pullet’s first bit of
real luck, it is the male of the <span class='it'>Gallus domesticus</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not call a male chicken that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Gerald assented, “no, but you ought to.
And not to do so is wholly un-American.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet why do you Americans call this particular
bird a rooster, when everybody knows that all birds
except ostriches and cassowaries roost, and that
every flying bird everywhere is thus a rooster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I admit that we do not reason about it as
you reason in Lytreia. I admit that the word
‘rooster’ is a word without connotations and without
any correspondence in anatomy. Nevertheless, every
nation has its customs. And it is as much our well-established
American custom to call the male of the
chicken a rooster as it is your custom to call that
thing a nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we call that a nose because it is, in point of
fact, a nose. It is, as we have told you I do not know
how many times, the Holy Nose of Lytreia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald was honestly exasperated by the obstinacy
of the people of this kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” said he, “if you want the truth—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke then the truth about that tongue, as it
appeared to him. But his remarks were lost to history
through the circumstance that none of his
hearers ever thought of setting them down in writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead, his hearers shuddered. They gave him a
black cock, and they drove him out of that temple. It
was in this way that Gerald put an affront upon the
Holy Nose of Lytreia.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>17.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Evaine of Peter’s Tomb</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW Gerald rode upon the silver stallion
toward the immemorial, moss-overgrown
tomb of King Peter the Builder, and Gerald
carried under his left arm the black cock. Gerald
noted, with an interest natural to any student of
magic, the glorification tree which grew beside this
tomb. He once more whistled meditatively. Then
he hitched his shining stallion to an over-candidly
carved and painted post which stood at the door of
the tomb, and he went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interior of this spacious tomb was lighted
with nineteen iron lamps swung from the ceiling.
Gerald thus saw, first of all, the great four-square
mirror covered with a flesh-colored cloth. Before it
fumed a smoking brazier; and beside this stood the
appearance of a woman. To her left hand was a
broad bed, and to her right, a gilded pig-trough
heaped with fig-leaves. These leaves this woman was
crumpling and tearing into little pieces one by one
before she destroyed them in the fire of the brazier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard Gerald’s civil cough. She turned: and
Gerald was enraptured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Evaine of Peter’s Tomb was so surpassingly
lovely that she excelled all the other women his gaze
had ever beheld. The colors of this beautiful young
girl’s two eyes were nicely matched, and her nose
stood just equidistant between them. Beneath this
was her mouth, and she had also a pair of ears. The
girl was young, she exhibited no deformity anywhere,
and the enamored glance of the young man
could perceive in her no fault. There was, to be sure,
a puzzling likeness to somebody he had once known,
but Gerald’s quick wits soon unriddled the mystery.
This woman reminded him of Evelyn Townsend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was this all. He observed now that this
woman was, just as he had suspected, a Fox-Spirit,
for now from Evaine of Peter’s Tomb emanated the
power of her magic. That magic which overmasters
all animals now smote at Gerald; and in a mildly
amusing way he found its assaults really quite interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For this is the goety of beasts,” he reflected.
“This is the brutish half-magic of the wu which
maddens men, along with all other animals in their
rutting season, and robs them of self-control. This
magic persuades me, almost, that I, too, am only a
bundle of cellular matter upon its way to becoming
manure. Yes, my life, too, at just this moment, seems
but a grudged brief season of bewildered appetites
and of baffled surmise such as is the life of a mortal
man. I, too, seem a mere human being passing from
the forgotten to the unforeseeable. Under the assaults
of this small carnal magic, I seem again to go
in that continuous masked loneliness which mortal
persons in Lichfield and elsewhere call living. I
long to put out of mind the frailness and the transiency
of my hold upon living. The nonsensical notion
has occurred to me that such forgetfulness may
be hired by bringing the epidermis which masks me
into superficial contact with the homogenous animal
matter in which hides this Fox-Spirit.... Yes, I
am being, as it were, maddened with desire; I am
very rapidly becoming the prey of this Fox-Spirit’s
irresistible powers of fascination, so to speak. And
I find it really quite interesting to observe how this
half-magic which destroys so many men now impiously
strikes beyond its proper arena, at that which
is divine; and how this foolish magic attempts to
deceive even me, who am a Savior and a sun god.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the cursory reflections which passed
through Gerald’s mind in the while that he said,
aloud, “Good-evening, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fox-Spirit Evaine, without replying to him
directly, took out of her bosom a white gem about
the size of an orange. She tossed this up into the
air, and caught it again. Gerald conjectured that
this was her soul, but he made no comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He displayed to her his cock, saying, as was needful,
“I entreat you to accept my rooster—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what,” asked learned Evaine, “what did
you call this tamed descendant of the wild Bankiva
fowl,—whose original habitat was in Northern
India from Sindh to Burma, and in Cochin China,
and in many of the Malay Islands as far as Timor,
and in the Philippines?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, in the United States of America, ma’am,
we, rather more briefly, and for a variety of reasons,
call this bird a rooster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been well observed,” she replied, “by
Pliny the Elder—a celebrated Roman naturalist,
born 23 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span>, perished in the eruption of Vesuvius
79 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span>,—that every nation has its customs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Fox-Spirit dexterously cut off the head
of Gerald’s cock with the sacrificial ax, and turning
toward the East, she spoke the needed words three
times. One entered now in a scarlet coat, a yellow
vest, and pale green knee-breeches. His head was
like that of a mastiff, with the addition of two horns
and the ears of an ass, but he had the legs and hoofs
of a calf. Such was he who carried off the black cock
which Gerald had brought for the Fox-Spirit’s
master, as a propitiatory offering and a trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald smiled. Gerald shook hands, politely, with
Evaine the learned Fox-Spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am,” said Gerald, “a god.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She replied: “I am one who serves all gods. I
honor every tribe of those divine beings whose existence
scholars have so variously accounted for as
the products of physical and ethical and historical
and etymological blunders abetted by homonymy and
polonymy. But I require for my piety a honorarium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is that honorarium?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as she spoke, Evaine drew near to him, and
yet nearer, and she was remarkably desirable. If
only she had not now reminded Gerald more and
more of Evelyn Townsend, she would have been
resistless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then!” said Gerald, affably: “you
shall have that honorarium to-morrow morning if
you still care to demand a reward so trivial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately afterward he said, “But, indeed,
ma’am, you quite misunderstand me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then with a few well-chosen words he placed
their relationship upon a more decorous basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Evaine the Fox-Spirit laughed. Such unresponsiveness
she declared to be, when manifested by
a god, wholly surprising, and comparable to the
Seven Wonders of the World, namely: (1) the
Pyramids of Egypt; (2) the Hanging Gardens of
Babylon; (3) the Tomb of Mausolos; (4) the
Temple of Diana at Ephesus; (5) the Colossus of
Rhodes; (6) the Statue of Zeus by Phidias; and
(7) the Pharos at Alexandria. Yet, Evaine continued,
she perceived that she might trust him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may do nothing of the sort!” said Gerald,
decisively. “You may not even give me all. No,
ma’am, it would be quite unadvisable, because, as I
am forced to point out, you in your unfading youth
and omniscient learning are many thousands of years
older than I am in my present incarnation. Beside
you, I am a mere boy. Now, it is often a great disadvantage
to a boy, it is by and by a curse to him, to
succumb to the loving confidence and generosity of
a woman much older than himself. It is unwholesome.
It is un-American.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it, then, inconsistent with the manners of a
continent in the Western Hemisphere—first named
America by Waldseemüller, a teacher of geography
in the college of Saint-Dié among the Vosges, in a
treatise called <span class='it'>Cosmographia</span>, published in 1507,—for
me to like you so much that I just want to touch
you and be near you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, that, I regret to say, is universal.
Besides, I did not particularly mean you. I only mean
that there are such women, as we both know, dear
lady, who prey upon young boys. They employ for
this purpose all their confidence and generosity
without the least scruple. And many a hard, bitter,
cynical man has originally had his faith in and his
regard for everything good and holy blasted in his
very first boyhood by the confiding nature and generosity
of some middle-aged woman or another and
her subsequent references to the advantage he took
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is possible that you speak with the clearness
recommended by Quintilian as the chief virtue of
speech,—born in Spain about 25 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span>, died about
95 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.D.</span>, patronized by Vespasian and Domitian,—but
it is certain that I do not understand one word of
your speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—However,” Gerald continued, “when a boy
has a nice, clean friendship with an older woman it
is one of the most valuable and helpful experiences
that can come into his life. A friendship such as this
appears to me a rather beautiful idea. The older
woman—particularly when she is older by many
thousands of years,—can teach him, as his mother
out of the superficial knowledge of a callow half-century
or so cannot possibly do, about women. She
can inspire and direct him. She can fire his ambition.
She can encourage him. She can be to him in every
way a liberal education.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, certainly, I shall never understand your
American way of uttering so many platitudes—derived
from the Greek word <span class='it'>platys</span>, meaning
‘flat,’—when I was attempting to do all these
things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but we must keep the education entirely
oral, and we must keep, too, your little hands—So,
now, that is very much better!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better still to permit a wilful person to have
his way,—a remark attributed to Periander, an
ancient sage, and Tyrant of Corinth during the
sixth century <span style='font-size:smaller'>B.C.</span>,—since you elect to give me my
honorarium for nothing,” Evaine said, rather
sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald elected to do nothing of the sort. But,
since his real intentions would have been an awkward
matter to explain, he kept silent about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that Gerald questioned the learned Fox-Spirit.
She explained to him willingly enough the
laws of Lytreia and described the basket they were
found in, and she made it plain just how these laws
were enforced by a committee of midwives and
stonemasons. She spoke of the magic she had put
upon Lytreia. She spoke of Tenjo, telling how in
the prime of his youth he came to be called Tenjo of
the Long Nose; and her statistics were remarkable.
She talked then about the wind between the stars,
and about the grandeur that was Greece, and about
Hobson’s choice, and about Davey Jones’s locker,
and about the cause of volcanoes, and about the
curate’s egg, and about the best cures for baldness.
For no information anywhere was hidden from the
wisdom of Evaine, who knew all things, and who
served all gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I perceive,” said Gerald, “that you have knowledge,
and I like your reflections extremely. So do you
speak yet further out of the stores of your omniscience!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been glancing all the while toward the
veiled Mirror of the Two Truths. But he of course
said never a word about this mirror. His present task
was simply to lure on this cultured and malefic creature
to her complete ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Fox-Spirit, as Gerald saw, was still about
the brutish magic of the wu, which drives men mad,
and she now spoke of more and yet more evil matters
such as were very well adapted to incite Gerald to
brutality. She spoke of the battle of life, and of
the feast of reason, and of the irony of fate, and of
the lap of luxury. She talked of the writing on the
wall, and of the scroll of fame, and of the lexicon
of youth, and of the cloud that had a silver lining.
She touched upon the two seas, of troubles and of
upturned faces. She discussed the durance that was
vile, and the hours that were wee and sma’, and the
consummation that was devoutly to be wished for,
and the light that was dim and religious, and the
heat which was not the humidity. She indicated the
balm in Gilead, the place in the sun, and the safety
in numbers. She afterward gave succinctly the recipes
for making a mountain out of a molehill, a silk
purse out of a sow’s ear, and a virtue out of a necessity.
For no evil phrase of any sort was hidden from
the wisdom of Evaine, who knew all things, and who
served all gods, and who was now intent to exercise
upon Gerald the magic of the wu, which drives men
mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerald only smiled, almost approvingly. This
woman was reminding him more and more of Evelyn
Townsend, and his pulses had not ever been calmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I perceive,” said Gerald, “that you have a great
deal of knowledge, with the vocabulary of a dear
friend to back it devastatingly. Therefore, ma’am,
to avail myself of your knowledge alone may serve
my divine ends much better than your really most
flattering proffers in other fields.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For now it was Gerald’s turn to speak. So now
he revealed to the baffled Fox-Spirit the fact that he
was Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and Preserver,
the Lord of the Third Truth, the Well-beloved of
Heavenly Ones, a very potent god who had temporarily
mislaid his mythology. He told the omniscient
Fox-Spirit, who knew all things excepting only how
and at what hour her knowledge would end, of Gerald’s
adventures during the rather crowded twenty-four
hours since he had left Lichfield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she was smiling over his obtuseness. For
to all-wise Evaine it was at once apparent that Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord
of the Third Truth, the Well-beloved of Heavenly
Ones, was a culture hero like Quat or Quetzalcoatl
or Cagn or Osiris or Dionysos. All these were
former acquaintances of hers: she knew, she said,
every inch of them, for each one of these had
stopped to visit her who served all gods, as each had
passed downward toward Antan. Evaine, if anybody,
would thus know a culture hero wherever she
saw a culture hero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every mythology contained one of these glorious
philanthropists, born of a mysterious and superior
race, just as Gerald had been born in the United
States of America, a philanthropist, as the learned
Fox-Spirit said, very usually theriomorphic, who
came in the appearance of a jackass or of some other
animal among less favored peoples to teach them
strange new arts and mysteries, and to endow them
with every kind of cultural advantage and prosperity,
just as Gerald had benefited the people of
Dersam and of Lytreia, and was preparing to benefit
Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed out, furthermore, that a culture hero
was in no way un-American. There had been, for
example, Quetzalcoatl. She also remembered quite
clearly Yetl,—because a deity in the form of a bird
was always, she said, rather difficult,—and Poshaiyankya,
and Coyote, and Esaugetuh, and that
other waggish Indian deity—his name at present
evaded her,—who had traveled incognito in the
shape of a large spider. For all these aboriginal
American culture heroes had visited Evaine as they
passed downward toward Antan, and every one of
them had been in a somewhat earlier generation Gerald’s
fellow countryman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the light of your forceful logic, ma’am, I concede
that, over and above being a Savior and a sun
god, it seems probable I must be a culture hero too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yet, in any case,—dear, unresponsive,
frigid child,” said the Fox-Spirit, speaking far more
simply than she had done before,—“do you not
know that all mythologies are controlled by the
Master Philologist, so that he alone may say in
which one of them and in what capacity you belong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find that saying obscure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means only that sooner or later all gods save
only Koleos Koleros and the upright spirit of the
Holy Nose pass down into Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, for, as they told me at Caer Omn, Antan
is the heaven of all deserving gods, where they rest
from their divine labors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Fox-Spirit shook her head, rather forebodingly.
“I, certainly, would not say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you, then, but answer me this very simple
question! What becomes of them there? what fate
befalls in that place all which men have found most
beautiful and most worshipful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can one say, when no god has ever returned?
It is known only that, in one way or another
way, the Master Philologist disposes of every deity
that men have served, save only the two supreme
gods of all mammals,—a class of vertebrates embracing
bats, the warm-blooded quadrupeds, seals,
cetaceans, man, and sirenians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald drew a long face. “Your account of the
matter, ma’am, suggests that my predecessor upon
the throne of Antan lacks piety. You imply that the
creature is deficient in true religious feeling. That is
a fault I would have to requite when I take from
him his throne and all the great and best words of
magic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To do that, child, needs power such as has not
been shown by any god among the many millions of
gods that men have worshipped since the first infancy
of Chronos,—a Greek personification of
Time, usually depicted as carrying a sickle and an
hourglass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but, my dear lady, I, who am at once a
culture hero and a sun deity and a Savior, must be
a peculiarly powerful god. And, besides, ma’am,
from what you tell me—Why, but, really now, it
appears probable that the Master Philologist has
damaged the Dirghic mythology to which I myself
belong! No god can patiently endure such usage;
and my divine wrath will, thus, redouble my power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, still,—but, still, you dear, nice-looking
and vainglorious baby—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evaine had paused. She was regarding him almost
compassionately: and Gerald felt he could never
get used to the flighty way in which people everywhere
in the Marches of Antan seemed to pity the
high gods. It was a quite friendly way they had of
looking at you, but to extend commiseration where
reverence was the proper thing savored almost of
irreligion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald shrugged. He said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall therefore be resistless. I shall compel
him to restore into general circulation the Dirghic
mythology, after having amply repaired whatsoever
damage he may have done to it, and then I shall assume,
in addition to his throne, my proper station
as a culture hero and a sun deity and a Savior in
that mythology. So the affair is, virtually, settled:
we may now turn to other matters: and in return
for the gracious aid afforded by your large wisdom,
I will make in your honor a sonnet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very beautiful sonnet,—consisting of
fourteen decasyllabic lines, expressing two phases of
a single thought or sentiment,” said Evaine the Fox-Spirit,—“and
I am proud to have inspired it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget,” said Gerald, “that I have not yet
recited my sonnet. I will now do so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his voice was so shaken with emotion that,
when he had completed the octave, he paused, because
it was never within Gerald’s power to resist
the beauty of a sublime thought when it was thus
adequately expressed in flawless verse. So for an instant
he stayed silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught up the lovely hands of Evaine the Fox-Spirit,
and as he pressed them to his trembling lips
he noted that these hands smelled like hops drying
in the sun. It seemed to him exceedingly pitiful he
had given that promise to Tenjo. It seemed to him
there was a certain sameness in the dear women who
made colorful the Marches of Antan, and, to some
extent, a similarity in their more intimate love
passages with Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and Preserver.
He found it depressing to reflect that destruction
waited, so very near, for so much loveliness.
He found it perfectly dreadful to foreknow that he
would often regret this omniscient Evaine and her
fine stores of useful information, once he had kept
the divine word given to Tenjo, and had put an end
to her living before she could do any further damage
to the men of Lytreia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gods ought to abstain from all love-affairs: for
through love alone might a god look to be wounded,—upon
rainy Sunday afternoons, perhaps, or after
drinking a bit more than was good for one,—to be
wounded, at such unavoidable seasons of low vitality,
with recurrent, plaguing memories of his
mortal playthings, so dear, so very dear, and so soon
reft away from his immortal arms, irrevocably....</p>

<p class='pindent'>After these cursory reflections, Gerald sighed,
and—with the thoughtful commentary that, since
this was a Miltonic sonnet, his poem here went on
with the same sentence,—he continued his reciting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when he had ended, the Fox-Spirit sighed
contentedly. She spoke with acumen and authority as
to the main events of Milton’s life and as to his
principal works, and she added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a very beautiful sonnet,—a verse form
of Italian origin, first used in English by Sir Thomas
Wyatt in 1557,—and I am proud to have inspired
it. That is the sort of poetry which would incline
any living woman to trust you and to give you all
the very moment you stopped reciting it. So now will
you not come to bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Evelyn, not to-night—I beg your pardon,
ma’am! My thoughts were wool-gathering. What I
had meant to say was but that if you insist upon yet
further displays of your great-hearted womanly
confidence and generosity you shall be walloped with
a broomstick—severely. No, do you retire now,
my dear lady, by all means, and with my apologies
for keeping you up so late because of the delight I
have got from your instructive way of talking. But
I shall pass the remainder of the night in the aloofness
appropriate to a god, in this quite comfortable
armchair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this he did.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch18'>18.<br> <span class='sub-head'>End of a Vixen</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>W</span></span>HEN Evaine was asleep, though, then
Gerald rose softly from his chair. He approached
the bed. Very carefully he inserted
his hand between the young breasts of Evaine,
and lightly he drew out the strange white gem. He
waited now, looking down compassionately at this
really very lovely girl....</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at his touch the learned Fox-Spirit had moved,
so that she now lay flat upon her back, with her
mouth a little open. Evelyn slept thus. And that was
why Evelyn snored....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald shrugged. He took up the sacrificial ax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that the dawn was at hand, he went out from
the tomb, to the glorification tree, and he began to
fell the tree with this ax. At the first stroke blood
gushed out of the gray bark copiously, and Gerald
heard a wailing noise. Gerald looked upward. The
appearance of a young child dressed in blue garments
was to be seen in a cleft in the side of the tree.
It had the seeming of a boy child about seven or
eight years old, a freckled boy, with tousled red hair,
and with as yet only one upper front tooth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This child wailed broken-heartedly: “A blasphemer
is come up against the Two Truths; a vainglorious
fool derides the pair that endure where all
else perishes; and life is denied to me by his wrongheadedness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald had put down the ax. He was trembling.
He did not like the love and the great yearning
which had awakened in his heart. He folded his
arms very tightly: he seemed tense and rather
frightened looking as he waited there peering sidewise
toward this boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” Gerald said, “what is your will that you
cry out for life from the glorification tree?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, I demand the life which you have
not given me, that life which you owe to me, and
that life which is denied me so long as you deny the
Two Truths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I serve the demands of my appointed kingdom,
child. I serve the needs of no other truth and the
needs of no pawing women who would keep me out
of that kingdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, your kingdom is a doubtful dream,
but the flesh of my mother is real.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dream is lovelier than any woman. Oh, and
a doubtfulness also is more lovely than the body of
a woman, for I know the shaping of that body over-well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father, you refuse the pleasures which will
not ever be returning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a god. I serve the needs of my own will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gods also pass, my father, they also pass
without any returning, upon the road which you now
tread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us pass, then, unhindered! But no woman
permits it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is because these women, O my father, have
a very rational wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is, perhaps, the case. But a god has his
irrational dream. And that is better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well enough, my father, for that dream to
end contentedly in the arms of some woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well enough. It is customary. But I am Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and the Preserver. I go to
my appointed kingdom: and I am Lord of a Third
Truth, whose mightiness I must help and preserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald hewed on: and as the tree fell, the
child vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Gerald set fire to the tree: and when a tidy
blaze was crackling, he spoke the needed words,
and into the heart of this fire he tossed the strange
white gem. Straightway you heard a loud screeching.
Out of the tomb of Peter the Builder came a vixen
fox, screaming and shuddering quite horribly, but
not ever ceasing to approach the fire. She entered
the flames. Silence followed, and the dawn of a
superb May morning which was marred only by an
unpleasant odor of singed hair and burning flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald after that went back into the tomb from
which the omniscient Fox-Spirit had been dispossessed.
He looked rather sentimentally upon the
empty disordered bed: then he passed beyond the
brazier, in which the ruins of fig-leaves yet smouldered,
toward the Mirror of the Two Truths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact no longer mattered, perhaps, that any
man who looked into this mirror straightway found
himself transformed into two stones: but it very
greatly mattered what effect this mirror would have
upon a sun god and a Savior and a culture hero. So
he removed the flesh-colored veil.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>19.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Beyond the Veil</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>B</span></span>UT he was not turned into two stones. Nor
was there confronting him any mirror. Beyond
the flesh-colored veil he found only an
ancient painting very carefully done, but upon an unhuman
scale which made this painting monstrous.
The subject of the picture, however, is not known,
because Gerald never told anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is known that Gerald shook his head at this
painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laborious daub of prevaricating pigment!”
he remarked. “O futile painting, which so many
foolish believers in Lytreia think to be the Mirror
of the Two Truths! I question your arithmetic. For
I myself am the Lord of a Third Truth, for all that
I have just at present no precise idea as to its nature.
In consequence, I know the two objects which you
magnify are not all which exists. And I deny
that their never-ending search of each other is the
one gesture of life. No: I at least, I feel assured, am
destined to take part in some quite other gesture,
of a more graceful and more cleanly and more dignified
nature,—a gesture of, it well may be, eternal
importance....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Gerald glanced about him a little forlornly.
This place was now rather lonesome and ambiguous
looking. In the crypt immediately beneath him, Gerald
knew, lay all that remained of King Peter and
the most of his numerous family; dozens upon
dozens of peculiarly ugly objects were there, all
that remained of a great conqueror and of the
queens who had delighted him, all that attestedly
remained now anywhere of a strong hero’s pride
and famous warfaring and of his many women’s
loveliness....</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, it may be,” Gerald conceded, half frettedly,
because he did not like to be troubled with
such reflections, “it may be that I am wrong in this
belief. And that seems to me yet another reason for
adhering to this belief. I, standing here alone upon
the remnants of so many utter strangers, admit
indeed to some depression of spirits. It seems to me,
at this exact instant, that just conceivably I may be
neither a Savior nor a sun god nor a culture hero,
but merely another bull-headed Musgrave, for
whom death waits, and after death, perhaps, oblivion.
Nevertheless, I find it a more beautiful and
a much more entertaining idea to believe in than to
deny the immortality even of a mere Musgrave.
There is to my mind nothing at all interesting in the
idea of my own extinction. And it appears that my
belief in this matter, with no assured knowledge anywhere
to go on, must be simply a question of
personal taste. Modesty even suggests that my belief
is an affair of irrelevance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said also: “Therefore it furthermore
appears to me, O peculiarly unimaginative
painting, a sheer waste of opportunity to assume
that anything is ever going to end even for a mere
Musgrave all conscious experience. I had far rather
play with a beautiful idea than with one utterly lacking
in seductiveness. I very much prefer to believe
that I at least am, in one way or another, reserved
to take part in some enduring and rather superb
performance,—somewhere, by and by,—in a performance
concerned with some third truth, more august
and æsthetically more pleasing than are the
only ever-enduring truths apparent to us here. We
copulate and die, and that is all?—Well, perhaps!
But, then again, perhaps not! One must, you see, be
broad-minded about the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He for a moment kept silence. That regrettably
candid painting and all the other adjuncts of this
place were certainly very depressing, now that the
learned diableries of the Fox-Spirit no longer enlivened
this tomb. Nevertheless, Gerald kept his
long chin well up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, every man ought to be broad-minded about
this matter, and ought to cherish always, if only as
a diverting and inexpensive plaything, this pungent
notion of being immortal. It is really inexpensive,
because, should your notion prove ungrounded, you
run no risk, no tiniest risk, of being twitted, by and
by, for credulity, or even of ever discovering your
error. Meanwhile this faith in your own durability
and potential importance is in some sense a cordial;
and is in sundry ways a fine toy. It renders life, and
dying too, endurable: and it offers against all vacant
half-hours a variety of diverting speculations...
as to that possible third truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Gerald paused. For it seemed to him, as he
unwittingly repeated the age-old self-persuasions of
so many of his ancestors, that he had found now
another facet in this jewel of an idea that he was
playing with; and this fact considerably cheered
Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, too,” said he, “then, too, that rather
wide-spread expectation of an oncoming triumph—somewhere,
in some hazed roseate arena, beyond
the discomforts of death and the incredible impudence
of the mortician’s titivating,—that triumph
which is to be a perpetual triumphing of justice and
of rationality and of kindliness and of all the other
canonical virtues, this rumored triumph yet cows
many persons, not infrequently, into one or another
thrifty-minded practice of these generally beneficent
virtues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said then: “It thus makes for, at any
rate, terrestrial ease and stability and repose: it
gives people, as the phrase runs, something to go
by, in that it supports the most of every nation’s
social and legal rules of thumb. And it tends appreciably
to limit men’s common greed and viciousness,
and all the harsher lusts of human beings, to
exercises through which there seems some quite tangible
gain within tolerably safe reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said also: “Yes: it is much better for
men to believe in some third truth which will be revealed
to them after the death of their bodies; and
a general faith in the immortality even of mere Musgraves
appears to me, thus, very plainly, because of
its happy blending of the functions of a narcotic and
of a policeman, a generally desirable assumption.
It remains in all ways a desirable faith, no matter
whether or not there be any grounds for it. And if
this careful painting presents the entire truth, that
fact is but another excellent reason for paying no
attention to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald now felt quite comfortable through having
listened so respectfully to his own relentless logic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For these reasons, O foolish painting of the Two
Truths, I deny your fleshly significance. Whether I
happen to be a sun god or a Savior or a culture
hero or just another bull-headed Musgrave, I deny
that you present to me any truth whatever. I snap my
fingers at your materialism; I turn up my nose at
your indecorous anatomical studies; and I send the
divine foot of the Lord of the Third Truth smashing
through your ancient canvas. These things I do to
proclaim the majesty of the Third Truth. And I
depart from this Peter and this Peter’s Tomb, to seek
my appointed kingdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this way that Gerald yet again put an
affront upon Koleos Koleros and upon the Holy
Nose of Lytreia.</p>

silver stallion, which Evaine the Fox-Spirit
had not, after all, demanded of him that
morning as her promised honorarium. And the next
place he came to, and where he got his breakfast,
was Turoine. This was a small free city given to
sorceries of two colors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To every side of him the inhabitants of Turoine
were about their arts: and Gerald, as a former student
of magic, quite naturally observed their various
activities with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the first sorcerer that he encountered was
making a figure out of pink wax with which was
mixed baptismal oil and the ashes of a consecrated
wafer. The next sorcerer was murmuring charms
over a very fat toad which was imprisoned in a net
rudely woven out of the golden hairs from the head
of some luckless, unresponsive woman, who was now
about to meet a not wholly desirable doom after that
toad had been buried at her threshold. And the
third sorcerer huddled over a small fire wherein
burned cypress branches and broken crucifixes and
portions of a gibbet. In his hand was a skull filled
with dark wine which had been seasoned with hemp
and with the fat of a girl child and with poppy seed:
and his familiar, in the shape of a large dun-colored
cat, was lapping up that bitter drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sorcerer anywhere in Turoine was idle upon
this fine May morning. And in this small, ever-busy
city—where all the buildings were quaintly marked
with stars and pentagrams and the signs of the zodiac
and the two kinds of triangles, and were cozily overgrown
with honeysuckle and arum lilies and black
poppies and deadly nightshade,—these sorcerers
were about a bewildering variety of studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” one of them told Gerald, “am learning the
secrets which proceed from Saturn, that ashy lord
of the greater infortune. I have especial power over
all husbandmen and beggars, over grandfathers and
monks of every order and ministers of the gospel,
over all potters, and miners, and gardeners, and cow-tenders.
I have learned how to make men envious,
covetous, slow of thought, suspicious, and stubborn.
And I am also able to afflict whatsoever person I
elect with toothache and dropsy and black jaundice
and leprosy and hemorrhoids, either severally or in
unison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another said: “I study to divine and to make
smooth the approach of every evil fortune,—with
smoke and arrows and wax, with an egg, with mice,
and with the simulacra of dead persons;—but, above
all, as you may perceive, I have been most successful
with the head of an ass in a brazier of live coals. And
my guide is not any bow-legged, swarthy eunuch,
but Leonard, the Grand Master of the Sabbat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I,” said a third, “have found in Turoine the
Great Juggle Bag, for my guide is Baalberith. So
have I mastered all kinds of unheard-of, secret, merry
feats and mysteries and inventions—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what,” asked Gerald, “what purpose does
your knowledge serve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By means of it, sir, those who are favored by
my lord Baalberith, the Master of Alliances, may
make real the sin performed in a dream; may open
the locked door of any jail or bedchamber or counting
house; may smite a husband with embarrassing
weakness; may inspire strange maids and married
women with flaming desires; may increase his natural
height here by seven ells and here by three inches;
may make himself invisible or invulnerable; may
change his form into that of a cat or a hare or a
wolf; may control thunder and lightning; may collect
and talk with snakes; and”—here the sorcerer
coughed,—“and may perform five other advantageous,
extravagant and authentic devices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerald shrugged. “These sciences are well
enough for a sorcerer; and I perceive that the industrious
may pick up much useful information in
Turoine. But I am a god who travels toward his appointed
kingdom, and toward the mastery of secrets
rather more vital than any of these. For your arts
are of that black magic which hurts but cannot help;
your guides are devils; and you deal only in misfortune
and destructiveness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then perhaps, sir, you may be better pleased by
the enchanters who live at the other end of this city.
For these enchanters have no guides save restlessness
and foiled desires and impotence; they get no
direct aid from hell, but from somewhat less ancient
intellectual centres; and they work all their magic,
such as it is, with words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what does the magic of these same enchanters
create?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It creates, sir, a comfortable sense of equality
with your betters wherever there is least reason for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find that saying obscure. Nevertheless, I will
visit these enchanters,” said Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he rode on.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch21'>21.<br> <span class='sub-head'>They That Wore Blankets</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HUS Gerald came to the enchanters who
were used to perform all their magic with
words. And they greeted his coming with a
very cordial enthusiasm for creatures so gray and
vague and bedraggled looking as they sat huddled
there, each one of them clothed in a blanket, and
thoroughly drenched as though with sour smelling
rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the first enchanter to speak wore a violet
blanket. He arose; and dripping bilge-water everywhere
about him in the while that he smiled with
wholly friendly condescension, he observed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is another rider on the silver stallion. Here
is yet another figure of papier mâché which Horvendile
has despatched upon a profitless journeying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I—” said Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without at all heeding Gerald, a second enchanter,
in a well soaked green blanket, laid down his scissors;
and he addressed the first enchanter with some
fervor, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us not speak harshly of our good Horvendile’s
magic, for everybody ought to respect the
impotence of the aging. We must concede, of course,
that his magic is no longer fresh. It is not possible
to deny that a woefully infirm magic has set this papier
mâché figure on a hackneyed journeying. Candor
compels us to grant that this journeying crosses once
sparkling rivers which have long ago run dry. We,
as intelligent enchanters, must admit that a wearying
fog lowers thickly about this journeying, that above
it the sun of romance shines very pale and cold, and
that this journeying is sterile and empty of gusto.
Nevertheless, this journeying, as we ought not to
ignore, is no doubt an afterthought, it is the belated
invention of a tired mind, and a desperate and ill-advised
proceeding. For these reasons, howsoever
sorrowfully we, as Horvendile’s fellow artists and
well-wishers, must always deplore among ourselves
the kindergarten notions of this poor Horvendile,
and his ponderous playfulness, and the limitations of
his few and unenterprising ideas, still we must be
careful not to apply to his magic one single harsh
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet—” Gerald stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nodding in profound and entire approbation,
with which Gerald was not in any way connected,
an enchanter in a sopping yellow blanket now
remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, too, am always ready to defend the magic of
our fellow practitioner. My conscience forces me to
grant that his magic is not faultless. In mere honesty
I have to confess that his magic is stupid and stilted
and silly; that it is sniggering and sly and nasty; that
it wallows in a morass of self-satisfaction; and that
it is steeped and soaked in ever-fretful egoism, in
spite of our friendly candor in all dealings with him
from the very first. Nor can I dispute that our confrère
behaves too much like a decadent small boy
who is proud of having been haled into the police
court for chalking dirty words on a wall. Apart,
though, from his stinking filth and his vileness and
his tinsel cynicisms, and aside from his bestiality and
his vulgar frippery and his dabblings in cesspools
and his vapid sophistries, I stand always ready to
defend the magic of Horvendile, because it is not,
after all, as if he were a mage of any real importance,
and one ought always to be indulgent to persons of
third and fourth rate ability.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so—” Gerald pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now an enchanter in a thoroughly drenched
scarlet blanket was saying, as he meditatively unclosed
his pastepot:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite agree with you. Nobody admires the
merits of our esteemed confrère more whole-heartedly
than I do. It would be merely silly to deny
that he has weakened his always rather wishy-washy
magic potions by too frequent blendings. It is impossible
to ignore that his magic has become a cloying
weariness and a mincing indecency. We are forced
to acknowledge that Horvendile is insincere, that he
very irritatingly poses as a superior person, that he
is labored beyond endurance, that he smells of the
lamp, that his art is dull and tarnished and trivial
and intolerable, but, even so, we ought also to admit
that he does as well as could be expected of anybody
who combines a lack of any actual talent with
ignorance of actual life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However—” Gerald explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth enchanter to interrupt Gerald wore a
black blanket; and he, too, appeared to drip with
wisdom and bilge-water and judicious amiability in
the while that he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, in fact, alike our duty and our privilege to
be most lenient with this laborious bungler who, after
all, is probably doing the best he can. So I, for one,
I never dwell even fleetingly upon the awkward fact
that the banality of his magic is no excuse for the
way he botches its execution. Indeed, I do not know
but that a person of very lively imagination might
conceive of our confrère’s turning out worse work
than he does. Nor do I think I am being over-charitable.
For, upon my word,—while I can see
that his magic is morbid, that it is sophomoric, that
it is malignant, that it is plagiarized, that it is intolerably
insipid, that it is sacrilegious, that it is naïve,
that it is pseudo whatever or other may happen to
sound best, that it is over brutal in cynicism, that it
is incurably sentimental, and that it bores me beyond
description,—yet otherwise I can, at just this
moment, think of no especial other fault to find with
his magic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it was that these dripping and affable enchanters
went on defending Horvendile with such generous
volubility that Gerald could get in no word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then each took off the single garment which he
wore, and so vanished, because without their wet
blankets these enchanters were in no way noticeable.
And Gerald rode away from that place contentedly,
because it was a natural comfort to know that he
traveled with a guide and a patron who was so well
thought of by the best judges.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch22'>22.<br> <span class='sub-head'>The Paragraph of the Sphinx</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW upon the outskirts of Turoine, after
Gerald had ridden through this city, Gerald
paused to talk with the Sphinx who
lay there writing with a black pen in a large black-covered
book like a ledger. The monster had so long
couched in this place as to be half-imbedded in the
red earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This partially buried condition, ma’am,” Gerald
began,—“or perhaps one ought to say ‘sir’—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either form of address,” replied the Sphinx,
“may be applicable, according to which half of me
you are considering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—This semi-interment, then, madam and sir, is
untidy looking, and cannot be especially comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I may not move,” replied the Sphinx, “in
part because I have my writing to complete, in part
because I know all movement and all action of every
kind to be equally fruitless. So do I retain eternal
bodily as well as mental poise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such acumen borders upon paralysis,” Gerald
said: “and paralysis is ugly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not despise ugliness!” the Sphinx exhorted,
“who have traveled thus far upon the road
of gods and myths. For what things have you found
stable upon this road save only Koleos Koleros and
the Holy Nose of Lytreia? and what is there more
ugly than these two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied: “That nose I found it my Christian
duty to describe as a tongue; and the lady whom
they call Koleos Koleros I have not yet seen. But,
in any case, you, ma’am—for, after all, it is not
quite nice for me to have your loins upon my mind—No,
really, it does seem more becoming for me to
treat you as a lady—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, and do you find me ugly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mistake my meaning. I was about to observe
that you, ma’am, also appear tolerably stable.
And the Mirror of Caer Omn, that likewise remains
in worship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dreams pass eternally varying through that
golden mirror. Thoughts pass eternally varying
through my wise head. But all these dreams and
thoughts stay barren, as barren as they are irresolute.
For we create nothing. We control no material
thing. And we aspire toward no goal. That is
why we are permitted to endure powerlessly in
realms wherein two powers alone are never barren;
wherein they control all; and wherein neither may
ever be uncertain of its goal so long as the other
survives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald found this wholly incomprehensible and
of no striking interest. So he only shrugged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, in my worlds,” Gerald said,
“there shall not be any ugliness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you, then, possess many worlds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as yet, ma’am. I allude to the worlds I shall
create by and by, when I have come into my kingdom
yonder, in the place beyond good and evil, and have
regained my proper station as the Lord of the Third
Truth in the Dirghic mythology.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Sphinx frowned. “I perceive you are
only another downfallen god upon your journey to
the Master Philologist. I might have guessed it, for
Thor and Typhon and Rudra and the Maruts and
all the other storm gods who have gone blustering
downward into Antan, all had red hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald slapped his thigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word, ma’am, but that is a real clue!
The storm gods did, in every mythology known to
me, have red hair. I incline to believe that the wisdom
of the Sphinx has solved the mystery of my
being. I am no doubt a storm god also; I am rapidly
becoming a complete pantheon upon two legs; and at
this rate my waistcoat will end by embracing pure
monotheism. Meanwhile I really do wonder, ma’am,
at your offhand way of speaking about the gods, and
I wonder, too, what grudge you can have against us
gods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For one thing, it is said that the gods created
those men who interrupt me in my writing to plague
me with just such silly questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men naturally seek wisdom from you, ma’am, to
whom the whole story of human life is familiar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the story of human life is not one story.
There are three stories of human life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ah! And what are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, there was once a traveling man who came
one night to an inn—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I have heard of his indecorous adventures
there. So do you spare my blushes, ma’am, and
tell me the second story!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems, then, there were once two Irishmen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That anecdote also, in all conceivable variants,
I am quite certain I have heard. So what is the third
story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was once a young married couple. And it
seems that on the first night—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet that story, in a great number of versions, is
equally familiar to me. And really, ma’am, I question
if these intolerably hackneyed tales sum up all human
wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the young married couple in the outcome got
pleasure for their bodies in the service of those two
powers which I was just talking about. The Irishmen
found an unlooked-for drollness in the mechanics
of those two powers, which they preserved in a neat
and nicely memorable phrase, getting pleasure for
their minds. So, by the way, did the two Jews and
the two Scotchmen. And the traveling man, upon
the next morning, after those same two powers had
obtained their will of him, went away from that
inn, traveling nobody knows whither; and so got,
through a darker night, unbroken and uncompanioned
sleep, unbothered any longer by those powers.
Thus these three stories really do sum up all the gains
which it is possible for a man to acquire through human
living and all the wisdom that it is salutary for
any man to know about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that is as it may be! I am persuaded that
in the goal of all the gods there is a more august
power than any which men know of hereabouts assuredly.
For I note the sympathy and compassion
and love and self-denial which human beings display
toward one another, after all, rather copiously.
I reflect that every art is a form of self-expression.
And I deduce that the artist who created human
beings was prompted in his embodiment of all these
qualities by sheer egotism. He observed these qualities
in his own nature: he approved of them: and so
he embodied them. No actually reflective person,
therefore, will ever imagine that human life does not
go forward toward some kindly winding-up, since
none who finds philanthropy in his own heart can
doubt that philanthropy exists in the heart of his
creator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does that stuff which you are now talking
really seem to you,” the Sphinx asked, “sensible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear lady, it seems to me something far better:
it seems to me a rather beautiful idea. So I play
with it sometimes. Now I dismiss that idea, out of
deference to your proverbial wisdom: and I ask what
far more gratifying and uplifting wisdom, ma’am,
you may be writing in your black-covered book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, my book!” said the Sphinx, with the
livelier interest natural to an author. “You find me
just now in some difficulty with my book. You conceive
there has to be an opening paragraph. It would
not be possible to leave out the first paragraph—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see that. I can recall no book in which there
was not a first paragraph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And this paragraph ought to sum up all
things, so to speak—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That likewise is a familiar rhetorical principle—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And it is with the composition of this paragraph
that I am just now having trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you could not possibly have consulted a
more suitable person. I, too, used to dabble in the little
art of letters before I became a god with four aspects.
I am familiar with all rhetorical devices. I am
a past master of zeugma and syllepsis; at hypallage,
and chiasmus also, I excel; and my handling of
meiosis and persiflage and oxymoron has been quite
generally admired. So do you read me your rough
draft: and I have no doubt I can arrange all difficulties
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sphinx for a moment considered this suggestion,
and, before the prospect of a connoisseur’s
efficient criticism, the monster seemed rather shy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be vexed unduly,” the Sphinx then said,
“if you can find no meaning in this paragraph—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not be excessively censorious, I assure
you. No beginner is expected to excel in any art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—For this paragraph was placed here simply
because there happened to be a vacancy which needed
filling—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I quite understand that. So let us get on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no hurrying the diffident Sphinx.
“The foolish, therefore,” the Sphinx continued in
shy explanation, “will find in it foolishness, and will
say ‘Bother!’ The wise, as wisdom goes, will reflect
that this paragraph was placed here without its consent
being asked; that no wit nor large significance
was loaned it by its creator; and that it will be forgotten
with the turning of the one page wherein it
figures unimportantly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt it will be!” said Gerald, now speaking
a little impatiently, “but let us get on to this famous
paragraph!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—So do you turn the page forthwith, in just the
care-free fashion of old nodding Time as he skims
over the long book of life: and do you say either
‘Bother!’ or ‘Brother!’ as your wits prompt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, I assure you, the moment your book is
published. But why do you keep talking about your
paragraph? why do you not read me what you have
written?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just done so,” replied the Sphinx. “I have
not been talking. I have been reading ever since I
said, ‘Do you not be vexed’ and now I have read
you the whole paragraph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said, “Oh!” He scratched his long chin a
bit blankly. He approached the monster, and leaning
over one forepaw, he read for himself in that
black ledger the paragraph of the Sphinx.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said, “But what comes next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were I to answer that question you would be
wiser than I. And of course nobody can ever be wiser
than the Sphinx.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is that as far as you have yet written?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as far as anybody has written,” said the
Sphinx, “as yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In all these centuries you have not got beyond
that one paragraph?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, do you not see my difficulty? I needed an
opening paragraph which would sum up all things, so
to speak, and all the human living which men keep
pestering me to explain. And when I had written it
there was not anything left over to put in the second
paragraph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, oh, dear me! This is materialism! this is
flat sacrilege committed in the actual presence of a
god! I am embarrassed, ma’am. I hardly know
which way to look before the spectacle of such conduct.
For you fill your page, with your ambiguous
paragraph—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not be vexed unduly if you can find no
meaning in this paragraph—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Which has not anything to do with my exalted
duties in this world—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This paragraph was placed here simply because
there happened to be a vacancy which needed filling—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am not a paragraph, ma’am! I am no less
a person, I may tell you in confidence, than Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord of
the Third Truth, the Well-beloved of Heavenly
Ones, upon a journey,—quite incognito, and therefore
unattended by my customary retinue,—toward
my appointed kingdom. And I confess that to my
divine mind your writing has not any valid significance—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The foolish, therefore, will find in it foolishness,
and will say ‘Bother!’—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And conveys no valuable lesson—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wise, as wisdom goes, will reflect that this
paragraph was placed here without its consent being
asked; that no wit nor large significance was
loaned it by its creator; and that it will be forgotten
with the turning of the one page wherein it figures
unimportantly—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite honestly, ma’am, I am not a paragraph!
No, I assure you that I really am the Lord of the
Third Truth, upon my way to rule over Antan. I am
the predestined conqueror who will force that irreligious
Master Philologist to refrain from any further
evil-doing, and to turn over a new leaf—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you turn the page forthwith, in just the care-free
fashion of old nodding Time as he skims over
the long book of life—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes!” said Gerald, smiling, “I was thinking
you could bring in that bit, neatly enough, if I gave
you the simile to start on. And I know, of course,
how all you authoresses love to quote your own
works. So now, ma’am, if I were to remark, in a
half puzzled way, that I hardly know what to say
about your irrational paragraph—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you say either ‘Bother!’ or ‘Brother!’ as
your wits prompt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so! And that finishes it. You have now
had the privilege of quoting in the course of one conversation
your complete collected works, from cover
to cover: and that ought to leave any authoress in a
fairly amiable frame of mind. My complaint, then,
ma’am, is that you have exhausted my time rather
than your subject. There should be by all means a
second paragraph. You see, dear lady,—and I am
speaking now from the professional knowledge of a
god,—it is the gist of every religion that—still to
pursue your bibliomaniacal metaphor,—one has but
to turn over that page in order to begin upon the
most splendid of romances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of romance can any dead man be
getting pleasure out of in his dark grave?” the
Sphinx asked, in frank surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must not speak over-hastily. I cannot
supply offhand your second paragraph until I have
learned what the Dirghic religion states to be the
nature of this second paragraph.... For, you conceive,
ma’am, in the opinion of many wise and virtuous
persons that paragraph deals with a voyaging in
the great sun boat, to a hidden land very far down
in the west, after the heart of each passenger has
been weighed against a feather, and forty-two judges
have passed favorably upon his claims to free transportation.
But dissenters, just as wise and virtuous,
and just as numerous, declare the subject of that
paragraph to be a pleasure garden in which properly
behaved persons will recline in continuous tipsiness
upon golden couches covered with green cushions,
cosily shaded by lotus-&nbsp;and banana-trees, and will
have no other occupation than perpetually to remove
the virginity of large-eyed celestial ladies. Yet, other
sages declare that paragraph to deal with the crossing
of a bridge—in which transit a peculiarly obliging
dog will serve as the guide,—into the presence
of the bright Amshaspands. Whereas, still other estimable
people contend that your second paragraph
should treat of a four-square city builded of gold
and jasper, upon a twelve-fold foundation of various
precious stones, and irrigated by its own private
crystal sea.... For, I repeat, ma’am, the best-thought-of
religions vary quite noticeably as to the
nature of this second paragraph: and it would be
wholly a sad thing if by speaking over-hastily I were
to run counter to my own mythology. But, in any
case, I have no sympathy whatever with the mental
morbidity of such materialism as would deny the
existence of any kind of second paragraph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald frowned, and he rode on.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch23'>23.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Odd Transformation of a Towel</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>G</span></span>ERALD now passed beyond Turoine, and,
crossing Mispec Moor, he came thus to the
tumbled-down hut of a decrepit old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how are you called, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that to you?” she answered, peevishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this wrinkled creature seemed to Gerald remarkably
red and inflamed and regrettably hideous
among her tousled tresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, ma’am,” replied Gerald, pleasantly, “a
name is a word: and words are my peculiar concern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it matters to you, young Carrot-top, I have
had many names. And under one name or another
I was used to deal with every man. Now my powers
fall into decay, and one month is like another month,
with never any changing in it. All about me is
bleached, dearie, all is colorless. There is no more
employment for me: and I am an old worthless
flabby white-haired creature, still palely quivering
with desire for the good ever-busy days—oh, and
for the nights too, dearie,—that are overpast. Eh,
dearie, though you would not ever think it, once I was
Æsred, a mother of the Little Gods and of much else.
And I fared handsomely then, taking liveliness and
color out of all things, and turning men into useful
domestic animals. But now the world is old, and I
am the world’s twin: and all vigorousness has gone
from me, and one month is like another month, with
never any changing in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a god who bring with me all vigor and all
youth,” said Gerald: for he remembered what the
Sphinx had said about not despising ugliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald spoke the appointed words: and he baptized
the old whining trot after the rite of the Lady
of the First Water-Gap. He straightway saw the
dingy towel about her shaking head transformed.
This towel had now become a crown composed, a
bit surprisingly, of the four suits from a pack of playing
cards. There were four clubs set upright, like the
strawberry leaves in a duke’s coronet, and alternated
with four spades: and the band of this crown was
moulded in bas-relief with eight hearts and with sixteen
diamonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, everything near Gerald was changed. To
Gerald’s right hand and to his left were seen neat
fields and green things growing pleasantly, and the
tumbled-down hovel was now a spruce new cottage.
But what seemed even more interesting to Gerald
was the circumstance that the wrinkled angry looking
old woman had become a quite personable creature,
not young and callow, but in the very prime of
life: and the name of Æsred now, as she told him,
and as he noted at least two other reasons for believing,
was Maya of the Fair Breasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she said also, forthwith: “Now that I am
young, and have not any chaperon in the house, it
would look better for you to be getting on with your
journey, because you know how people talk. Yes, and
how quick they are to be talking about all widow
women anyhow—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! oh!” said Gerald: “are you not, then, prepared
to trust me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—With or without,” continued Maya, “the
least provocation. As for trusting you or any other
young fellow living, I never heard before of such
nonsense. It is only the elderly men that any woman
can depend on, just as far as she can see them, in
broad daylight, a good while after they can be depended
on at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not even ready to give me all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maya was reasonable. “I will give you your dinner,
and on top of that your hat. For I can have no
vagabond god hanging around my neat cottage when
I am trying to get the dishes washed, and have the
name of a widow to keep respectable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” Gerald stated, with conviction, “is an
unusual woman. I search the pages of history in vain
to find any parallel to the strange behavior of this
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald reflected. Very certainly this Maya
of the Fair Breasts did not excel all the other women
his gaze had ever beheld. Yet the colors of her two
eyes were nicely matched, and a fairish nose stood
about equidistant between them. Beneath this was a
tolerably good mouth, for all that the lips were sullen:
and the indefinitely brownish hair, which was
queerly arranged in nineteen formal braids, no
doubt concealed a pair of well-enough ears. This
rather heavy-visaged woman was reasonably young,
she seemed hardly more than thirty-seven or thereabouts:
she exhibited no deformity anywhere: her
figure was acceptably preserved, her breasts were
positively alluring.... In fine, the appraising
glance of the young man could with the kindly eyes
of twenty-eight perceive in her no really grave fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, she reminded him of no woman that he
had ever seen anywhere before this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Gerald said: “I am satisfied. I shall stay for
dinner. I shall thankfully accept all the refreshments
you proffer, of every kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Maya answered: “But, indeed, you sauce-box,
you quite misunderstand me. So do you keep
your proper distance! For I am not the sort of
woman that you seem only too well acquainted with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said, with a caressing thrill in his voice,
“Yet, do you but answer me this very simple question—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maya replied, “Oh, get away with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus speaking, she boxed the jaws of the predestined
ruler over all the gods of men; and with a few
well-chosen words she placed their relationship upon
a more decorous basis.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch24'>24.<br> <span class='sub-head'>On Mispec Moor</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>G</span></span>ERALD, after they had dined, persuaded
Maya of the Fair Breasts to permit him to
rest over for supper also, now that his journeying
was virtually complete. For beyond the home
of the wise woman upon Mispec Moor the way lay unimpeded
to the ambiguous lowlands of Antan, where
Queen Freydis and her consort the Master Philologist
ruled in, it was said, a very old, red-pillared
palace which had once belonged to still another
queen, named Suskind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as to this Antan, Gerald could not, even now,
learn anything quite definite, because of all the gods
and myths who had passed down into Antan none ever
returned. It thus stayed, as yet, regrettably dubious
whether these glorious beings now all lived together
in unimaginable splendor, as Gerald had gathered at
Caer Omn; or whether, as ran the gloomier report
which prevailed in Lytreia, they had each been destroyed
by the Master Philologist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In any case, from Mispec Moor you clearly saw
Antan. Thus, there remained for Gerald hardly more
than an hour’s ride, and perhaps a morning’s spirited
work, in order to complete his predestined conquest
of his appointed kingdom. Gerald therefore rested
until to-morrow, with this not over-hospitable hostess,—who
viewed him with such uncalled-for suspicion
that (as he found toward midnight) the
woman had actually bolted the door to her room,
out of a foolish notion that he might be trying to
enter this immovable door, from which he was, instead,
with entire dignity tiptoeing away. He rested
so as to be in his very best fettle when he approached,
to-morrow, the climax of his superb
achievements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile he questioned Maya of the Fair
Breasts as to his future kingdom; and she told him
it was a poorly thought-of place. Nobody ever went
there, Maya said, except such trash as poets and
threadbare myths and over-inquisitive persons and
such celestial riffraff as had lost their station in human
esteem and their priests and their temples, said
Maya, nodding her head rather gravely. That curious
crown of hers sparkled cheerily with every movement
of her head, for she sat at the window in a
patch of sunlight, about her darning. And as to what
became of such worthless people, Maya continued,
after they reached Antan, that, certainly, was a question
of no importance—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but what is the general opinion hereabouts,
among the sorcerers and enchanters of Turoine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our opinion is that the matter is not worth
bothering about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but what do you think—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maya looked up from her darning, in mild but
candid surprise. “You really do ask the silliest questions!
For one, I do not think at all about those outcast
tramps and vagabonds except to see that they
steal nothing as they go by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then Gerald questioned her about Freydis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of the woman,” said Maya, rather
absent-mindedly, as she went on with the darning
upon which stayed fixed her actual attention,—“of
course: but nothing to her credit. They report, for
example, that she has a mirror—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, too, have heard continually of that mirror,
but never of exactly what she does with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For that matter, Gerald, I also have a mirror,
if that is all which is needed. Everybody has a mirror.
In fact, I have a number of mirrors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I have noticed them everywhere about
the cottage. But all your mirrors, dear lady, are rose-colored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—To which Maya replied irrelevantly, and without
looking up from her darning: “But did you not
know from the first that I was a wise woman? In
any case, it is said that Queen Freydis holds her mirror
up to nature, and that she does not scruple to
hold this mirror up to her disreputable visitors, too.
For they really are, you know. It is all very well being
a god while it lasts. Only, it never does. And then
where are you? Why, exactly! That is why the overlords
of Turoine have always seemed to me more
business-like. And there is no flaw in it, people say,”—now,
though, as Gerald deduced, Maya was talking
about the Mirror of the Hidden Children,—“no
distortion of any kind, no flattering in it, and
no kindly exaggeration. It is not in anything like
my more sensible rose-colored mirrors. And nobody
could of course be expected to approve of such a
mirror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, if there indeed be any such mirror,
I mean to face it, when to-morrow I enter into my
kingdom, and liberate the great words of the Master
Philologist, and restore the Dirghic mythology, for
in that mythology, I must tell you, I am a god with
four aspects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense you do talk!” said Maya, comfortably,
as she slipped the darning-egg into another
stocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald confided in her. Then Gerald told
Maya of how he, howsoever unmeritorious, was heir
to all the unimaginable wonders which harbored
yonder. He told her that he and none other was Fair-haired
Hoo, the Helper and Preserver, the Lord
of the Third Truth, the Well-beloved of Heavenly
Ones. He told her of everything that had happened
in his triumphant expedition, thus far. He told her
of somewhat more than had happened, for under
Gerald’s expansive handling of the rather beautiful
idea of his own invincibility the tale became an epic.
And Gerald told her, too, of how he intended to
rule in the goal of all the gods. He briefly indicated
his summer and winter palaces, the probable personnel
of his harem, the deities who would serve in
his immediate household, and, in a general way, the
worlds which he would create: and he promised to
remember Maya, liberally, after he had come into
his kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Maya all this while went on darning placidly.
She admitted that men—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, as I was telling you, I am a god,—a god
with no less than four aspects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That did not really matter, Maya considered. The
gods, as near as she had been able to judge those
scatter-brained ne’er-do-wells that went tramping by,
were just the same, and, if anything, more so. It was
simply incredible, she continued, how little wear there
was in a stocking nowadays. She then admitted that
male persons did have these notions, even about such
unlikely places as Antan. And Gerald would, in any
event, be finding out for himself all about Antan to-morrow,
because if he for one solitary instant
thought she was going to have him hanging about
her cottage forever—!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now, my dear, but hospitality is a very
famous virtue: and, besides, you owe it to me
that you are now the handsomest woman in these
parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that, Gerald,—even if it were the truth, of
course, for you need not think you are fooling me,
you scamp,—that is just why people will be imagining
things if you continue to stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let us take good care not to be suspected
unjustly, because that would be unfair to everybody—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, get along with you! and do you pick up
every one of those stockings, too, now you have
scattered them all over the floor. And really, you
red-headed pest, I am not joking, either. That horse
of yours—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, that horse of mine! I admit that to the
discerning eyes of a woman it is not the handsomest
beast in the world. And I suppose you are about to
point out that this horse is unworthy of me, and that
I ought to dispose of it, in one way or another—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But whatever nonsense are you talking, now!
It is an extremely handsome horse. There is some
sort of prophecy about it, too, is there not? So you
would be even more foolish than you seem to be, to
part with that horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to be sure, there may be something in what
you say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And what I was attempting to tell you is that,
if you will simply permit me to talk for one minute
without interrupting—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hereafter I remain as quiet, my dear, as a belch
in polite society; and you may go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then, I was trying to say that your horse
can get you to Antan within an hour. You can find
out for yourself all about the place. And I daresay
this Queen Freydis, from all I have heard of her,
will not have the least objection to your rude way of
grabbing and pawing at people and interfering with
my housework and generally misconducting yourself.
It is the sort of thing she is quite used to. But I do
not like it: I feel you would not do it if you really
respected me. And I am sorry if anything I have said
or done has given you any such wrong notions about
me. And if you stuck yourself with that needle it was
simply your own fault. And that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied: “You are regrettably lacking, my
dear, in the confidence and the generosity peculiar to
your sex. It is impossible for the mind to conceive of
anything more dreadful than your conduct. Nevertheless,
I must stay until Wednesday, for otherwise
I cannot possibly judge of your magics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well, then!” Maya answered, with unconcealed
regretfulness over the fact that she would
have to put up with Gerald for yet another day.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch25'>25.<br> <span class='sub-head'>The God Conforms</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>F</span></span>OR Gerald, upon reflection, had decided it
would be really amusing to remain upon Mispec
Moor until Wednesday, since only upon
Wednesday could Maya show the perfection of her
thaumaturgy. Thursday, though, as the wise woman
forewarned him candidly, was her cleaning day; and
she simply could not be bothering over company with
the house all topsy-turvy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I also warn you well in advance, my darling,”
said Gerald, “that the performance must be
gratis, since I have no material possessions, save possibly
my riding-horse, to barter for the privilege of
witnessing your parlor magic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, but what in the world would I be needing
with another horse, who already have dozens of them
eating their heads off all over the moor? and when in
the world, you pest, I became ‘your darling’ I would
really like to know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, but have you, indeed? The very first moment
I saw you, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do wish you would sometimes, just for a
change, talk half rationally. And of course it has
always been my custom to further the true happiness
of the men with whom I was particularly intimate by
turning them into domestic animals of one kind or another.
Quite a number of them came out horses—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not altogether approve of such a custom.
Still, women have incalculable fancies: and all men
find out sooner or later that it is less trouble to indulge
these fancies than to thwart them. At any rate,
a god has no concern with these minor sorceries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not!” Maya agreed. “A scatter-brained,
talk-you-to-death, carrot-topped, and generally
good-for-nothing god is not concerned with anything
except with getting on to that minx Freydis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald waved aside the insinuation. He continued
to talk about more immediate matters, and he
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, your story interests me. It would
be droll to have a horse like that. So suppose, now,
my dear, suppose that I trade my divine steed for
one of those unusual horses of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Gerald, really I would rather not. For the
men that I put my magic upon used once to be fine
knights or barons or even kings,—and, for that
matter, there were a couple of emperors, though
only in a small way,—and I confess to a certain
sentiment about them still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in a clay chafing-dish Maya of the Fair
Breasts burned fig-leaves with benzoin and macis and
storax. And she showed Gerald how one might master
mercurial things. She displayed to him the small
magics which are Wednesday’s. She revealed to him—cursorily,
since they had only a morning at their
disposal,—the secrets of remunerative mediocrity
in the learned professions, in truth-telling, in upholstering,
in the removal of mountains into the sea,
in the erection of bridges over any unpassable place,
in the preparation of rose-colored mirrors, in criticism,
in oratory, in jurisprudence, and in the safe interpretation
of Holy Writ. As himself a former
student of magic, Gerald found these formulæ of
interest: but, as a god, he regarded Maya with profound
respect, as one who, with no native divine advantages,
had yet mastered this quite reputable stock
of knowledge and ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the workings of these magics were not apparent
until Gerald had put on the spectacles which
Maya gave him. He found these glasses so soothing
to the eyes that he retained them, just for the remainder
of his visit to her cottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, after all, Gerald decided to stay over the
week-end, since Maya was so unflatteringly eager to
be rid of him. It was an eagerness troubling to his
self-respect. Here was he, a god whom women had
always run after, and had pestered beyond reasonable
endurance, here was he, of all persons, being
treated with unconcealed indifference by a mere
hedge-sorceress, by a creature who had not even any
remarkable good looks or wit to justify her impudence.
This Maya of the Fair Breasts needed taking
down quite a large number of pegs. So Gerald fell
to wooing her with an ardor that somewhat surprised
him. For it was eminently necessary, it was,
indeed, a rather beautiful idea, to win the woman,
and then to jilt her, so as to teach her, once for all,
not ever again to make free and easy with the will of
a god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Maya had suggested that he conceal
the fact he was a god; and that she should introduce
him to the local gentry of Turoine as a visiting sorcerer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For I must tell you, Gerald,” Maya said, “all
the best-thought-of people hereabouts are in one or
another branch of sorcery. We have, thus, never had
any relations with Heaven. All our connections have
been with another quarter. And it is not that we are
unduly conceited and exclusive, it is simply that it
has just happened so. Nevertheless, so many gods
have straggled by, on their way to an ambiguous end,
as they went down to encounter the Master Philologist,
and whatever it is that he does to them, that
there is a tendency among the best people hereabouts,
as I will not conceal from you, to regard them as not
quite the sort that one meets socially.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I—!” said Gerald, in uncontrolled indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, my poor boy, you are entirely different.
And I am perfectly broad-minded about it, myself.
But other people are not. And it would sound much
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald spoke with dignity and firmness. Gerald
said that not for one moment would he stoop to
such a subterfuge. Not for an instant would he who
was a lord of all exalted white magics pretend to be
a sorcerer soiled with infernal traffics and patronized
by mere devils. After that, Gerald passed as a visiting
sorcerer.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch26'>26.<br> <span class='sub-head'>“Qualis Artifex!”</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>ND Gerald used to amuse himself by talking
with the travelers who passed by the
neat log and plaster cottage of Maya the
wise woman, upon their way to the court of Queen
Freydis and her consort the Master Philologist. For
it was a good and shrewd policy, Gerald felt, for a
monarch to familiarize himself with his future subjects:
so he would sit by the wayside, in the shade of
a conveniently placed chestnut-tree,—incognito, as
it were,—and would artfully allure them into conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hail, friends! And what business draws you to
the city of all marvels?” said Gerald, on the first
morning that he fell into this long-sighted course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was told—by the big-bellied, yellow-haired
man, whose skin was so curiously spotted,—that
they were two poets upon their way to Antan, the
goal of all the gods, and the friendly haven of true
poets, where poets might hope to find at last that
loveliness which they desired and could nowhere discover
in their everyday life upon earth. To Gerald
this was excellent news, since it increased the number
of his future subjects very gratifyingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he said nothing, while the big-bellied, spotted,
thin-legged gentleman in the purple robe adorned
with golden stars, went on in his answer to Gerald’s
first question, by explaining that the speaker was
Nero Claudius Cæsar, the king of all poets, and that
his scrawny companion, in a brown doublet of which
both elbows needed patching, was an artist of considerable
talent from out of the Gallic provinces,
who was called François Villon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald found this also of some interest, in view
of what he remembered about the Mirror of Caer
Omn. Not often did you thus come face to face with
two discarded personalities. But Gerald said nothing
about this either. Instead, he questioned Nero
yet further, and he thus learned that these two poets
were on their way to the court of Freydis, because
there alone in the universe was art properly regarded:
for there, indeed, true artists were manufactured
out of common clay, and were informed
with the fire of Audela.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one or another old hero from out of Poictesme,
Nero had heard, who had first modeled these
earthen images; and Freydis, as occasion served,
gave life to these images and set them to live upon
earth, as changelings. But, above all, said Nero, in
Antan the true poets of this world fared happily
among the myths and the gods who once had afforded
to these poets such fine themes, so that to-day
of course these poets wrote even more splendid
poems now that they composed with the eye upon
the object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, Nero thought, playing idly with the emerald
monocle which hung upon a green cord about his
scrawny neck, this Queen would not be very likely
ever to create in clay, or to find coming to her court,
such another artist as Nero himself had been in the
days of his Roman pre-eminence. No other person
known to him had ever excelled in all the polite arts.
For in dancing and in oratory, in wrestling (even
with such dreadful adversaries as lions) and in music
both vocal and instrumental,—alike as a charioteer
and as a tragic actor,—but, above all, as a poet, and
equally as a dramatic, a lyric and an epic poet,—Nero
had been unanimously awarded the first prize
in every contest. He did not care to appear boastful:
yet, by all canons of criticism, one had to consider
the list of his overwhelming triumphs, in Rome, in
Naples, in Antium, in Alba,—at the Parthian
games, at the Isthmian games, at the Olympic games,—and,
in fine, in each contest which Nero had ever
entered anywhere in all the kingdoms of which he
was Emperor. No other artist had a record to compare
with that: no other of the world’s great geniuses
had ever been confessedly supreme in every polite
form of æsthetic endeavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, as a student of history, Nero conceded
that the elect artist was not to be placed, not permanently,
by his ranking in the eyes of his contemporaries,
who might often be swayed by such matters,
really extraneous to enduring art, as the artist’s
ingratiating manners and his personal beauty. As a
man of the world, he even conceded the judges of
the sacred games in awarding all the first prizes to
Nero might furthermore have been influenced by the
large sums of money which the Emperor always conferred
upon his acclaiming judges after such occasions,
as well as by the dexterity of the tortures
which would have followed any decision less
just.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the indisputable fact, the fact of superb importance,
was that Nero had made of his life a poem
which was wholly a unique masterpiece in the way
of self-expression: he, above all other men, had
served the one end of every poet’s art, by revealing
the true nature of man’s being; for Nero had embodied,
with loving carefulness, each trait which he
found in himself, through some really memorable
action,—rearing, as it were, among marshes and
quicksands, and in yet other places which other persons
feared to visit, those strange and passionately
colored orchid growths which alone could express
the highly complex nature of every man’s desires—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That jargon becomes somewhat senescent,” said
Gerald. “Still, as a museum piece,—yes, even now,
sophistication does display something of the quaint
beauty of thorough obsoleteness. It has acquired the
charm, and, as it were, the patina, of sedan chairs
and of full-bottom wigs and of girdles of chastity
and of suits of armor, and of all other things, once
useful enough, which are nowadays endeared to
every poet’s heart by the fact that they are forever
outmoded. So let us grant it, O Cæsar, in the days
that are gone you were a devil of a fellow and a sad
rip among the ladies—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, but, for that matter—” Nero began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. You broad-mindedly despised neither
sex. You were in amour a Greek scholar. You were
something of a surgeon also. I concede it, I blush,
and I urge you to omit all embarrassingly personal
details.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Nero went on, saying that other emperors,
with very much his chances, had lacked the genius
necessary to develop these chances. There had, of
course, been minor artists. Caligula, for example,
among so much hackwork in the way of throat-cutting,
had shown at least one jet of rather lovely
inspiration when he attempted a criminal assault
upon the moon; that was a really finely imagined bit
of work. Then, also, Domitian and Commodus and
Tiberius had displayed praiseworthy ambitions;
quite neat little things had been done by Tiberius,
in an amateur way, at Capri; Caracalla too had been
so-so: but they had all tended to wallow unimaginatively
in cut and dried executions; merely to chop
off anybody’s head was not art, no matter how often
you did it. Besides, work done upon a public scaffold
inevitably coarsened one’s touch. And Heliogabalus,
whatsoever the lad’s thin vein of undeniable talent
in the way of lyric lechery, had lacked the stamina
and gusto for any sustained masterpiece in Nero’s
copious epic style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Nero alone had been, in every branch of self-expression,
the sincere, skilled artist, enriching his
handiwork always with that continual slight novelty
which art demands. He had builded his appropriate
stage, in the Golden House—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A house entirely overlaid with gold,” said Gerald,
reminiscently, “and adorned everywhere with
jewels and mother of pearl, a house so rich and
ample that it had three-storied porticos a mile long,
and huge revolving banqueting halls, and ivory ceilings
which perpetually scattered perfumes and red
rose-petals—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nero, at that, had out his emerald monocle; and
through it he now regarded Gerald with the childlike
amiability of a sincere artist whensoever his vanity
is flattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Nero admitted, he had endeavored to express
himself in that house also. The Golden House
had been (to play with metaphor) the handsome
binding of that poem which was his life, when in a
setting such as the world had never known, before
or since, he had given to his every human trait its
full color value. In the Golden House he had reared
his orchids, he had labored to open many frank and
incisive and utterly unstinted avenues of self-expression
to that somewhat complex thing called human
nature....</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here he entered rather explicitly into details.
Gerald felt the style of this emperor to be growing
woefully un-American; and Gerald fidgeted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us, I again urge you,” said Gerald, “speak
of less personal matters, and diversify the vividness
of these orchids with a few fig-leaves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps, of course, the Emperor continued, he,
like every other really great artist, had been somewhat
the anthologist, in that he had invented outright
none of the art forms among the many in which
he had distinguished himself. He had taken over
from his predecessors a number of inspirations and
a formula or two, as he would be the very last to
deny: but the fine craftsmanship was all his, as well
as that distinguishing, that peculiarly Neronic, touch
of romantic irony, by virtue of which this artist had
slain with suavity, had destroyed with a caress, and
had ennobled all that was most dear to his human
nature by killing it. He spoke now of the deaths of
his wives, of Octavia and Poppæa, and of others
who had been his wives just for the evening; he
spoke of Sporus, of Aiëtes, of Narcissus, and of
that other exceedingly beautiful boy, Aulus Plautinus....</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again Gerald raised a protesting hand. “Let
us still,” said Gerald, “avoid these quite un-American
personalities! Meanwhile, you do not
speak of your mother Agrippina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He surprised in the spotted face of Nero something
very like terror. But Nero said only, “No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And besides, the Emperor continued, with rising
animation, that happy chronological accident, the
fact that Christianity began in the days of Nero
its advance toward world supremacy, had enabled
him, by pure luck, to lend to the great poem of his
life just the needful felicitous touch of working in a
new medium. To burn well-thought-of taxpayers
and putative virgins as the torches at your supper
parties was a device which, out of a natural desire
to surprise and to amuse one’s guests, might have
occurred to almost any host in quest of that continual
slight novelty which the art of hospitality also
demands. But that these flambeaux should later become
the brightest glories of a triumphant church
had made these supper parties, which were really
quite modest affairs, unforgettable. Nero had expressed
himself—not merely, as he thought at the
time, through persons supposed to be deficient in
patriotism and more or less suspected of being
(here again, to play with metaphor) not one hundred
per cent Roman,—but, as it had turned out,
through saints and apostles, and through consecrated
religious martyrs, such as not every artist
could get for his themes and raw material. So,
the succeeding discouragements of Christians had,
æsthetically, fallen flat, in their impression upon
posterity: their authors had come into this field too
late, to find that tragic vein worked out, and all its
most striking possibilities exhausted, by the great
artist that was Nero. It was hardly remembered
that Marcus Aurelius and Diocletian and many
others had broken and flayed and mutilated and
burned to the very best of their ability: these plodders
were but the epigoni and the unimaginative
plagiarists of Nero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So had it come about that of all the emperors
Rome had known, and of all the tyrants and despots
in every land and era, who had followed the fine
art of self-expression, and who had shown what
human nature really is—in, as it were, the nude,
when any man is released from time-serving and is
made omnipotent,—of all these, there had remained
just one whose name was remembered everywhere;
just one whose fame was imperishable; just
one who had become a never-dying myth: and that
one was Nero. The legend of Nero was, in a world
wherein every other man stayed more or less unwillingly
an unfulfilled Nero, the supreme type of the
literature of escape. The legend of Nero was a poem
which men would not ever forget: it was a poem
current in all languages: and it was a poem which,
now, everybody could cordially admire and delight
in, because time had removed the need of considering
any current moral standards or one’s own physical
safety in judging this poem, now that Nero was
only a character in a book, like—as the Emperor
said, with a quaint revealment of his retained interest
in literature,—like Iago or Volpone or Tartuffe.
For whether you called any particular book
a history or a poem or a drama did not, of course,
effect the impressiveness and vigor and complexity
of the character drawing in it, nor the value of the
author’s apt and edifying revelations as to any eternal
verities of man’s being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For, certainly,” said Nero, “my life presented,
as no other artist has ever done, the gist of all human
nature as that nature actually is, when freed of such
inhibitions as constrain it in but too many baffled
lives. My life was, thus, a connoisseur’s production,
and a work of art which escaped even the grave risk
of anti-climax. For there was not anything lacking in
the ending of it, either. My fall and the circumstances
of my death were so æsthetically right that,
as an artist, I never in my life enjoyed anything
quite so much. Nothing could conceivably have
been in better taste. For, overnight, as you may remember,
I passed from the throne of the world, to
hide in a tumbled-down out-house, under a ragged,
very faded blue coverlet, and to perish thus by my
own hand,—with an appropriate tragic verse upon
my lips,—and without any friend remaining anywhere.
No tragedy could have been more boldly
proportioned, with all the Aristotelian unities so
exactly preserved. And it was most gratifyingly led
up to, too. For just as I was about to approach the
dénouement of my poem, the statues of my Lares
tumbled down miraculously, the hind quarters of
my favorite riding-horse were transformed into
the hind quarters of an ape, and the doors of the
mausoleum of Augustus having unclosed of their
own accord, there issued from the tomb a divine
voice which summoned me to destruction. These
incidents, I repeat, were gratifying, for they showed
that the exercise of my art had been viewed by
Heaven appreciatively. Ah, yes, in all I was peculiarly
favored.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch27'>27.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Regarding the Stars</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>V</span></span>ILLON spat meditatively between his yellow
front teeth. He fingered, in the while
that he continued his reflections, his scarred
and puckered lower lip. Then he confessed that he
dissented from a great many of his predecessor’s
remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were impressive. Your life was a competent
job, boldly executed, and nobody denies its merits
on their own melodramatic plane. Yet it lacked the
indispensable touch of tenderness, without which
no work of art is of the first class. No: it was I who
was truly favored; and I made of my life a flawless
poem without dragging in such gaudy accessories
as thrones and burning cities and the wasting of a
lovely, mother-naked virgin on a mere lion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this François Villon went on to speak of the
great blessings which had been accorded him. He
had been granted irresolution, and lewdness, and
poverty, and cowardice, and a large weakness for
drink, and an ingrained dishonesty, and a disease-wrecked
body, and everything else which was needed
to make him a knave as contemptible as any man
could hope to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was, in brief, gentlemen, as I have elsewhere
remarked, a hog with a voice. And there was no
voice like my voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For out of the mire that wallowing, lustful and
cowardly beast had sung. Now he sang jeeringly,
and made fun of the whole world with satire and
mockery and invective, and with plain filth-flinging,—which
was all quite good art, because it pleases
people to see a man superior to his fate. Now he
sang piercingly of the great platitude that death
conquers and ruins everything: and to that sentiment
nobody can ever turn a deaf ear, because it is the
only sentiment with a universal personal application.
But, above all, he sang of his regret for his past indiscretions,
and of his yearning for spiritual cleanliness,
and—“soaring,” as Villon now quoted, with
admirable complacency, “to the very gates of
Heaven upon the star-sown wings of faith and song,”—he
had proclaimed his trust in that divine love
which, ultimately, would redeem all properly repentant
persons from the logical outcome of their doings
in this world, and would give to the marred life of
every properly repentant person a happy ending
in a fair-colored paradise agreeably full of harps
and lutes. And people liked that, too, of course, because
such a philosophy made everybody feel muggily
consoled and, for no especial reason, magnanimous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So had Villon become a very great poet whose art
was a fine blending of mirth and of pathos and of
faith, and so might he hope to win to high honors in
Antan, where, if anywhere, poets were properly rewarded.
And the squalor and degradation of his
terrestrial living were, now, but so many picturesque
ingredients in the superb poem of his life, now that
Villon too was—just as his Roman confrère had
pointed out,—to be regarded as a character in a
book. The difference was that Villon had become a
never-dying myth of vagabondage with its heart in
the right place, and a parable which revealed how
much of good always survives in the most vile and
abandoned of criminals and even in persons unsuccessful
in business life. The legend of Villon thus
proved exactly the contrary to that which was proved
by the legend of Nero: as the one demonstrated
the real nature of man to aspire only to lust and
cruelty the moment that inhibitions were removed,
so did the other legend show the real fundamental
nature of every man to be incurably good and lovable
under all possible surface stains. And the legend of
Villon, Villon repeated, had in it tenderness,—that
indispensable flavor of tenderness and of a sentimentality
as wholesomely nourishing as molasses,
without which no work of art can ever really be of
the first class so far as goes its popular appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my life, gentlemen, was truly a superb parable.
And it has been properly appreciated, it has
ever been paid the fine compliment of being plagiarised
by Holy Writ. Why, what the devil! if the parable
of the Prodigal Son be good art in the New
Testament, is it the less good art for being acted out
with the vigor and the brio I brought to that task?
For I too wasted all my substance, with some feminine
assistance, and went down among the swine and
the husks, without ever forgetting that by and by I
was to be comforted with never-failing love and
veal cutlets. In brief, although I lived perforce in
the gutter, yet my eyes were upon the stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald remarked, to this one of his discarded
personalities: “You move me, Messire François.
You sound upon my heart-strings a resounding chord,
through your employment of a figure of speech which
is always effective. I do not know why, but any imaginable
bit of verse conveying a statement manifestly
untrue can be made edifying and sublime through
ending it with the word ‘stars’. We poets have convinced
everybody, including ourselves, that there is
some occult virtue in the act of looking at the stars.
So, when you said just now, ‘Although I lived perforce
in the gutter, yet my eyes were upon the stars’,
I was moved very mightily. I seemed to hear the
yearning cry of all human aspirations, foiled but
superb. Yet if you had asserted your eyes to have
been habitually, or at least every clear night, upon
the planets—or, for that matter, upon the comets
or the asteroids,—I would not have been moved in
the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is sufficient that you were moved without
knowing why,” observed Nero. “That is the magic
of poetry. Very often when I recited some of my best
poems, to commemorate the sorrows of Orestes or
Canace or Œdipus, I myself could not quite understand
the springs of that terrible misery which convulsed
my hearers. They wept; they fainted; a number
of the women entered prematurely into the labors
of childbirth; and I was compelled to have the doors
and windows guarded by my Praetorian soldiers because
so many of the audience invariably attempted
to escape from the well-nigh intolerable ecstasies
which my art provoked. Such is the magic of great
poetry, a thing not ever wholly to be explained even
by the poet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “Yet, you two poets who have
traveled through the Marches of Antan, wherein
only two truths endure, and the one teaching is that
we copulate and die,—do you not look to find when
you have reached Antan, which is the goal of all
the gods, some third truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it seemed to him that the faces of the two
myths had now become evasive and more wary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nero replied, “For a poet, there exist always just
as many truths as he cares to imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Villon remarked: “I would phrase it somewhat
differently. I would say there exist more truths
than any poet cares to imagine. But it comes to the
same thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Gerald assented,—“for it comes to an
evasion. Yet I, who also am a poet, I retain my faith
in the rather beautiful idea of that third truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Gerald told them that he himself had
long dabbled in the art of poetry. “Indeed,” he
added, generously, “I will now recite to you one of
my sonnets which appears appropriate to the occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dog,” Villon replied, taking up his hat, “does
not eat dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nero very hastily stated that, howsoever unbounded
their regret, they really must be hurrying
on to the city of marvels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So these myths departed, traveling together, with
an intimacy somewhat remarkable in the light of
their flatly diverse teachings. And Gerald warned
them to make the most of the present state of affairs
in Antan, because the day after to-morrow the Lord
of the Third Truth, a deity with several not uninteresting
aspects, would be descending upon Antan, to
take over all the powers of the Master Philologist,
and to deal with Queen Freydis afterward as his
divine inclinations might prompt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter Gerald went back to Maya and to his
dinner quite jauntily, now that he knew in his appointed
kingdom the true poets of this world were
assembling to purvey his amusement: and he felt
himself to be afire with impatience to reach that city
of all marvels, yonder behind him, as he walked away
from Antan, leisurely ascending to the trim cottage
of Maya the wise woman, who went as a
crowned queen, and would have none of his love-making,
and yet was such an excellent cook, in her
plain way.</p>

because Gerald was cordially amused by the
fond magics of Maya of the Fair Breasts.
He regarded them, as he did her, through those
roseate spectacles which the wise woman had loaned
him to be an unfailing comfort to his eyes: and he
found all very good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had known many lovelier and more brilliant
women, alike in the relinquished world of Lichfield
and in his journeying through the Marches of Antan.
But Maya contented him: he had really not the heart
to disappoint his Maya by not forcing upon her—after
four prolonged and tender arguments,—those
physical attentions which all women seemed to expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, she put aside her crown; and Gerald
never saw it any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And after that, also, the date of his departure
from her neat cottage was postponed until after Sunday,
though it was quite understood that, the very
first thing after a particularly early breakfast on
Monday, he would pass on to enter into his appointed
kingdom, and to possess himself of the Master Philologist’s
great words, and to reanimate the Dirghic
mythology in which he was a god, and would come to
know the third truth over which he exercised celestial
authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile he stayed upon Mispec Moor, to regard
with indulgence, and even with some pity, his
predecessors in Maya’s affection, those beguiled men
whom she had converted into domestic animals. His
divine steed was for the while turned out to graze
with those docile geldings that had once been knights
and barons and reigning kings: all wandered contentedly
enough about the neat cottage, along with a
number of steers and sheep and three mules, who,
also, had once been noblemen and well-thought-of
monarchs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald saw that these animals seemed not dissatisfied
with their transfiguring doom. Yet it appeared
a bit wanton—even to him, who had once
been a tortoise and a lion and a fish and a boar pig,—that
these gentlemen should have been snatched
from positions of responsibility and worldly honor,
from thrones and tournaments and large bank accounts,
and set to eating grass in a field. And Gerald
sincerely pitied them for their ignorance as to the
correct way in which to deal with the small magics
of Maya.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dear woman herself you could not blame. She
could not help trying, out of pure kindliness and
affection, to hold men back from daring and splendid
exploits, because she really thought they would be
much safer, and more happy, as domestic animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in fact, she justified her charitableness with
a logic which was plausible. She argued that all men
were better content after they had become domestic
animals. She pointed out that her lovers, in particular—Why,
but Gerald could see for himself how
little vexed were her steers and geldings, now, by
affairs of the heart. Upon every imaginable moral
ground they had been made better by their double
transformation. They did not run after lewd females,
they were not bloodthirstily jealous of one another,
and they were asleep every night at a respectable
hour. If Gerald had only known them, as she had
known them, when they were gentlemen of high distinction
and reigning monarchs, he would never argue
about an improvement so obvious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, domestic animals were spurred by magnanimity
and altruism into no devastating wars,
thrift did not often make them covetous of money,
neither did self-respect induce them to spend money
foolishly: religion did not lead mules to bray in any
pulpit, nor did the conscientiousness of a sheep ever
make of him an ever-meddling and pernicious pest.
In fine, the domestic animals were undisfigured by
any human virtues, and were quite easy to get along
with. Whereas, if any woman attempted to have that
many men about the house—! Maya, who had lost
so many husbands (at least partially) did not complete
the statement. But her expression made the
aposiopesis eloquent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald had no smallest doubt but that, if he himself
had not been divine and beyond her arts, Maya
of the Fair Breasts would long ago, out of pure
kindliness and affection, have transformed him too
into a sheep or an ox or some other useful quadruped,
and would thus have held him back from his appointed
inheritance in Antan. And he did not blame
her. The placid, stupid, rather lovable woman simply
did not understand that to be contented was not all:
she did not comprehend the obligations which were
upon a god to live with generous splendor and to perform
very tremendous feats in the way of heroism
and of philanthropy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, just as she said, the exploits of a champion
who came to enlighten and improve any place—even
to redeem it from what, by the standards of
the United States of America, was iniquitous and
backward and probably undemocratic,—did of necessity
upset the routine to which the inhabitants had
grown accustomed. Antan, as Gerald looked down
upon it from the porch of Maya’s cottage, seemed a
contented and tranquil realm. No matter by howsoever
un-American standards people might be living
there, to redeem the place from those standards
would bring upsetment and confusion. And it did
seem almost a pity—just as Maya said,—to be
bothering people who were contented enough, when
you too were contented.... Even so, there was an
obligation upon a god. To be contented, to have no
cares to worry you by day, to lack for nothing by
day, and every night to induce decorously through
connubial affection a profound and refreshing slumber,—that
was not everything a god desired. Yonder
there was a third truth. Yonder was Gerald’s appointed
kingdom, and not here upon Mispec Moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides, Gerald had begun to wonder more and
more about Freydis. By all reports, it was she who
really ruled those hills and lowlands yonder, which
to-morrow—or at least, next week,—would be
Gerald’s hills and lowlands; and it was she who controlled
in everything the Master Philologist, whom
Gerald was appointed to overthrow. It had not been
prophesied, however, so far as Gerald knew, how he
would deal with Freydis. That, to every appearance,
was a matter left to his divine election. Well, one
would not be over-harsh with any woman whom
rumor declared so beautiful, Gerald decided, half
drowsily, as he sat there so utterly comfortable in
the spectacles and the dressing-gown and the brown
carpet slippers which Maya had provided, and so
pleasantly replete with Maya’s excellent cooking.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch29'>29.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Leucosia’s Singing</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>ND upon another day, as Gerald sat by the
roadside beneath his chestnut-tree, and
waited for supper to be ready, three persons
passed toward Antan, traveling together. They were
all notable looking men; and Gerald greeted them
with the sign which is known only to supreme mages.
They returned his greeting, but they shaped signs
that were of an older magic than any which was familiar
to Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the first of these men said, “I was Odysseus,
Laertes’ son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald thus knew that before him stood yet another
of his discarded personalities. But Gerald made
no comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Odysseus continued: “I had wisdom. My prudent
wisdom was to men of every calling an object
of considerable attention, and the fame of it reached
Heaven. I ruled in Ithaca, an island kingdom, well
situated toward the west. I went unwillingly with the
other well-greaved Greeks to besiege Ilion: the enterprise
to me seemed rash, and unlikely to be remunerative:
yet, being engaged, I dealt prudently, and
in the end, where so many merely brave persons had
failed, it was through my prudence that the enterprise
succeeded. For ten years Ilion defied the strength of
Achilles and of Ajax; Ilion derided all the endeavors
of auburn-haired Menelaus and of godlike Agememnon:
but the cunning of Odysseus felled Ilion in one
night. I took my share of the spoils; I left the glory
to them that wanted it. I returned across the world
to that which I more prudently desired, toward the
quiet comforts of my home in craggy Ithaca. The
prayer of the blinded Cyclops, the wrath of earth-shaking
Poseidon, the white thunder of offended
Zeus, and the twelve winds of Æolus, all fought
against me. I prevailed. The sea-witch Scylla, an exorbitant
lady with twelve arms, a ravening monster
whom none might pass and live, I passed. Charybdis,
which devoured all, did not devour me, for I clung
prudently to a fig-tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed,” said Gerald, “the leaves of that tree
are very often a great protection,—O much-enduring
and crafty Odysseus,” Gerald added hastily, as
became a Greek scholar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moreover, the sun’s daughter, fair-haired Circe,
and bright Queen Calypso, the divine one of goddesses,
these also detained me rather more amiably.
I embraced them; they did not find me slothful in
their beds. For they were goddesses, as quick in anger
as they were in lust. It is not prudent to deny a goddess.
From the fond arms of these immortals I
passed on toward my desired goal. Yet nobody is
always prudent. When my ship approached the island
of the man-devouring Sirens I caused the ears of my
sailors to be stopped with wax; but I caused myself
to be bound to the mast, so that I might hear the
song which Leucosia sang in the while that Parthenopê
and Ligeia made a sweet music. I desired to
hear without any hurt that song which was so lovely
that it drew less prudent men to the arms of its
singer, wherein, as they well knew, dark death
awaited them. I heard that song. It did not matter
to me that I saw how the low beach about those
music-makers gleamed, like silver, where a thin sunlight
fell upon the scattered bones of many men whom
they had slain. I struggled to cast myself into the
gray sea-water, so that I might go to Leucosia. But
my bonds held me. I was bound, both my hands and
feet were bound, with very strong cables. The black
ship passed onward, whitening the water with its
polished blades of fir-wood; and I wept as I too
passed onward, away from my own ruin, and drawing
nearer to the goal which my prudent wisdom had
desired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly, the enchantment of her singing must have
maddened you. Yet such is the magic of great poetry,”
Gerald remarked, “a thing not ever wholly
to be explained even by the poet.... Yet your
goal, nevertheless, was reached, they tell me, O much-contriving
Odysseus. Your goal was reached, as I
remember it, in the many-pillared hall of your home
in Ithaca, and in a fine slaughter of those suitors who
were pestering your wife because they believed that
she was your widow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very naturally my goal was reached. I was Odysseus.
Very naturally I made an end of those wasters
of my substance who had been eating and drinking
for nine years at my expense. There arose, as one
by one their heads were smitten off, a hideous moaning.
The floors ran with blood. It was wholly plain
that Odysseus faced those imprudent persons who had
made over-free with his flocks and his wine jars and
his wife and the other goods of his household. Yet
I knew, by and by, that what I now desired was not
to be found in craggy Ithaca nor in the calm embraces
of Penelope nor in the tranquillity of my well-ordered
home. I gave laws. I heard cases. I decided
squabbles between one shepherd and another shepherd.
I who had contrived the burning of Ilion now
oversaw the branding of my cattle. War did not
trouble Ithaca, of whose king all other kings were
afraid. For I was very famous. I lacked for nothing
in wealth. I lived at ease. But no man hears the singing
of Leucosia except at a great price. I heard
Leucosia no more. I heard, instead, the voices of
fools praising my strength and my prudent wisdom,
and the voice of my wife talking sensibly about I
never noticed exactly what. I lacked for nothing
which prudent men desire, in my snug, sleek, well-ordered
Ithaca. But I had seen too much in my voyaging
about a world which was more lewd and riotous
than I permitted anybody to be in my Ithaca. I remembered
too many things. No, I did not regret
Calypso nor Circe nor that fine girl Nausicaä. I could
at will have returned to them. But I remembered the
singing of Leucosia, to whom I dared not return. For
no man hears the singing of Leucosia except at a
great price.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of what did she sing, O much-planning Odysseus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sang of that which haunted me, and which
derided the rewards of my prudent wisdom. She
sang of the one way to that which I truly desired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, O noble son of Laertes, is not a remarkably
explicit reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the wise Greek regarded Gerald sombrely.
Odysseus said, by and by:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sang of that which troubles a prudent person’s
soul and despoils his rational living of all fat
contentment. Let it suffice that she sang, I think, of
Antan. That is why I must travel to Antan, wherein—it
may be,—is my desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—It was only then that Gerald recollected something.
He recollected that Evadne of the Dusk, that
feathery-legged Evadne, who, Horvendile had said,
was called Leucosia in the days of her sea-faring. But
Gerald said nothing about what, after all, was none
of his affair....</p>

<div><h1 id='ch30'>30.<br> <span class='sub-head'>What Solomon Wanted</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>ND then the second traveler spoke. He
spoke of that which had been his in the days
when all riches and all pleasures and all
power had been accorded to Solomon because of his
sixfold wisdom. To no other being that ever lived
among mankind was given such mightiness as was
granted to King Solomon in the time that he reigned
over Israel and ruled this world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Solomon had sexanary wisdom. Solomon
knew the six words which were not known to any
other men. He understood the speaking of these
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word of the beasts. It was spoken, and there
assembled in the sight of Solomon a pair of every
creature that walks or creeps upon earth, from the
elephant to the smallest worm. Upon the neck of
each was pressed the seal of Solomon, so that the
race of each must henceforth be subject to him. They
revealed to him the wisdom of the beasts that perish
and do not bother about it. He feasted them at a
table of silver and iron which covered four square
miles; and at that banqueting Solomon the King
served as the pantler, bringing with his hands to
every beast and reptile its food according to its kind,
from the elephant to the smallest worm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word of Morskoï. It was spoken, and all manner
of fishes rose to the surface of the sea’s water
near Ascalon. Upon the neck of each was pressed
the seal of Solomon. Then came a hundred thousand
camels and a hundred thousand mules laden with
new corn, and all the creatures of the water were
fed, and after that they served King Solomon,
and they revealed to him the wisdom of the Sea
Market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word of the fowls. It was spoken, and the
sky was hidden by the birds who came to render
fealty and to instruct King Solomon in the wisdom
of the Apsarasas. The peewit alone did not come.
But he came afterward, crying, “He that hath no
mercy for others, shall find none for himself.” And
it was the peewit who fetched to Solomon wise Balkis,
and who taught Solomon to look through the
surface of this earth as a man peers through a sheet
of glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word of the Adversary. It was spoken, and
the entire citizenry of hell kneeled before King Solomon,
saving only Sachr and Eblis. The female Djinns
were shaped like dromedaries with the wings of a
bat; the male Djinns were like peacocks with the
horns of a gazelle. The Mazikeen and the Shedeem
came also. To the neck of each was pressed the seal
of Solomon: and they revealed to him both the black
and the gray wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word of Arathron. It was spoken, and
there came to King Solomon the Seven Stewards of
Heaven. The eyes of Solomon were closed, and his
hand had shaken a little, as he pressed to the neck of
each kneeling Steward the seal of Solomon, for he
was troubled by the exceeding glory of the supreme
Princes of Heaven. Of these the most terrible were
Ophiel and Phul, whose reign is not yet. But these
seven Stewards also served King Solomon; and they
revealed to him the white wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The word of the mirror. It was spoken, and before
him stood a wicker cage containing three pigeons.
Beside this cage lay a small mirror three inches
square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these six words were known to the wise King.
It was the power of these six words which made him
lord over the wild beasts and the birds of heaven,
and over the devils and the elemental spirits and the
ghosts of the dead, and over the sea-depths, and
over the cherubim. All creatures upon earth trembled
before King Solomon because of these six words:
no other king withstood Solomon, nor sent forth
his chariots against the army of Solomon. For the
soldiers of Solomon were the beasts of the field
and of the wild wood; the birds of prey were his
horsemen; the little birds were his very cunning spies.
His admirals were the huge whales and sea serpents,
and Leviathan also served in the navy of King Solomon.
His lieutenants were the overseers of hell; the
supreme angels were his counsellors. He had also
his mirror. The power of these six words was exceedingly
great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet there remained one other word, that word
which was in the beginning, and which will be when
all else has perished. There stayed yet unrevealed that
word which is spoken by the Master Philologist to
all the gods of men. That word alone was not known
to King Solomon. His little mirror showed him that
word, as it showed every other thing; but the word
was written in a language which he could not read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What need is there for you to be bothering about
that word?” said all the women who loved and cherished
him. He answered, “I do not know.” The wives
and concubines then stated, speaking with nine hundred
voices in unanimity, that no one of them had
ever before heard of such nonsense. And he answered
them again, “I do not know....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason King Solomon must pass down
into Antan, to hear the speaking of the last great
word of power.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch31'>31.<br> <span class='sub-head'>The Chivalry of Merlin</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HEN said the third of these wise men: “I
was Merlin Ambrosius. The wisdom that
I had was more than human, for it came
to me from my father. But I served Heaven with
it. The land was starved and sick and frightened.
Many little chieftains fought in its wild naked
fields, and murderously waylaid one another in
its old forests, causelessly. I made the land an ordered
realm. I gave the land one king, a king whose
sword was as bright as thirty torches. That sword
flashed everywhither about the land to enforce justice
and every other virtue commendable to Heaven.
Arthur Pendragon and the knights who served him
all served my whims. They were my toys.... I in
my playing gave to the gaping, smooth-chinned boy,
and to his shaggy followers, a notion to play with in
their turn. This notion was that each one of them,
and that every other man, was the child of God and
his Father’s vicar upon earth; and that each human
life was all a journeying home, toward a not ever
ending happiness, and that it was a journeying which
should be performed in a style appropriate to
Heaven’s heir apparent. Those savages believed me.
They were joyous both night and day. They learned
to be envious of no one, to love God, and to support
no unjust cause. They learned to speak seasonably
and graciously, to be generous in giving, to clothe
themselves neatly, and to sing and dance, and to war
fearlessly against evil. It all quite upset my father....
Yet my notion was, I still believe, a very beautiful
notion. It created beauty everywhere, because, as
I have said, the heir apparent of Heaven must journey
homeward in an appropriate style. Yes, the results
were eminently picturesque. Caerleon arose;
there was no city more delectable upon earth than
was the pleasant town of Caerleon, builded upon Usk
between the forest and the clear river. Arthur sat
there upon a daïs over which was spread a covering
of flame-colored satin. Under his elbow was a cushion
of red satin. The lords and princes and the knights
sat about King Arthur Pendragon, each in his order
and degree. The oppressed and the unhappy came to
Arthur. He was to the young a father, to the old a
comforter. Wrong was loathsome to him, the right
was very dear to Arthur, and he knew not what it
was to fear. My father did not think at all well of
him.... But I was pleased with my toys, for now
I found in every part of the land a romantic strange
beauty. The knights rode at adventure upon enormous
stallions. They clanked as they rode. They
went masked in blue armor and in crimson armor
and in silver-speckled green armor. Upon their heads
were brightly colored lions and leopards and griffins
and sea horses, and very often their helmets were
wrapped about with a woman’s sleeve. The giants
that these knights fought against were mighty giants
who ate at one meal six swine: the dragons that they
fought against were marvelous huge worms with
shining scales and wattles and magnificent whiskers.
The maidens whom they rescued were each more
lovely than the day. These maidens had blond curling
hair and frontlets of red gold upon their heads.
About each tender and rose-tinted body was a gown
of yellow satin. Upon the feet of these maidens were
shoes of variegated leather fastened with gilt clasps....
In fine, the heirs of Heaven discharged their
moral and constabulary duties quite picturesquely
as they rode homeward. It was in this way I who was
Merlin Ambrosius played with heroic virtues: it was
thus that I who was the son of my father made, for
my amusement, men that were more virtuous and
colorful than Heaven had ever been able to make
them. Still, still, it really was a rather plainly outrageous
notion upon which all this was founded: and
by and by the dear and droll, and heart-breakingly
beautiful antics of my flesh and blood toys did not
content my desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald remarked, now that the old gentleman had
paused in his meditative speaking, “Your desire,
Messire Merlin, as I remember it, was for an enchantress
who outwitted and betrayed you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men,” Merlin answered, with a grave smile,
“have made a mistake in that report. Is it likely
that I could be outwitted? No: I was Merlin Ambrosius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Merlin told Gerald about the child
Nimuë, who was the daughter of the goddess Diana,
and of how old, wearied, over-learned Merlin had
come to her in the likeness of a young squire. He told
of how they played for a long while with his ancient
magics, there in the spring woods, beside a very clear
fountain in which the gravel shone like powdered
silver. To make this twelve-year-old child laugh, as
she did so adorably, the mage had turned into prettiness
and drollery every infernal device. He created
for the child Nimuë, there in the April woods, an
orchard full of all those fruits and flowers, howsoever
unseasonably mingled, which have the liveliest
sweetness and flavor. Phantoms danced for her wide-eyed
amusement, in the shaping of armed knights
and archbishops and crowned ladies and goat-legged
fauns: and it was all quite excellent fun.... Then
Merlin told to Nimuë, because she pouted so adorably,
the secret of building a tower which is not made
of stone or timber or iron, and is so strong that it
may never be felled while this world endures. And
Nimuë, the moment that he had fallen asleep with
his head in her lap, spoke very softly the old runes.
In the while that she continued to caress her lover,
she imprisoned Merlin in an enchanted tower which
she had builded out of the magic air of April above
a flowering white hawthorn-bush, so that Nimuë
might keep her wonderful, so wise, dear lover utterly
to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was happy there for a long while,” said
Merlin. “My toys, now that I played no more with
them, began to break one another. Dissension and
lust and hatred woke among them. They forgot the
very pretty notion which I had given them in their
turn to play with. The land was no longer an ordered
realm. My toys now fought in the land’s naked fields,
and they murderously waylaid one another in its old
forests. Arthur was dead, at the hands of his own
bastard son begotten in incest. It was an awkward
ending for the heir apparent of Heaven. The Round
Table was dissolved. The land was starved and sick
and frightened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Merlin, the old poet who did not any longer
delight to shape and to play with puppets, had
paused: and he sat gazing thoughtfully, with wholly
patient, tired eyes, at nothing in particular. Then
Merlin said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard of all these things. They did not matter.
I was happy. Yes, I suppose that I was happy. My
ways were utterly domestic. They stayed thus for a
long while.... There was no variety. In that small
heaven which a child had builded out of the magic
air of April there was no variety whatever. There
was no enemy, no adversary for me to get the better
of through some cunning device. There was only happiness....
Nimuë stayed always young and kind
and beautiful and contented just because I was there.
The child loved me. But there was no variety. No son
of my father stays forever a domestic animal. So in
the end I who was Merlin Ambrosius found my desire
was not in that tower of April air. There was only
heaven. There was only just such a never-changing
happiness as I had once talked about to the gaping,
smooth-chinned boy and to his shaggy followers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet how could you escape from the blessings of
a happy home-life, Messire Merlin, if that tower
was truly enchanted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does not seem reasonable that I should tell
you all my secrets,” Merlin replied, drily, “any more
than it seemed reasonable that the son of my father
should share every secret with Nimuë. The child
loved me utterly. And I loved her. Yes, I loved
Nimuë as I have loved no other creature fluttering
about earth. She did not seem to walk.... Even
so, I was Merlin Ambrosius. So in the end I left my
child mistress. I quitted the small heaven which a
child’s pure-mindedness had contrived. And I go now
into Antan to get, it may be, my desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there was silence, now that the three mages
had all spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald shook his head. “You gentlemen have
talked with gratifying candor. You have expressed
yourself, with chaste simplicity, in very plain short
sentences. You have reasoned powerfully. You imply
that neither a wife nor a mistress, or even a harem, is
able to dissuade a wise man from this journeying toward
the goal of all the gods. I infer that, to the
contrary, the domestic circumstances of no one of you
were wholly satisfactory in the old time. Well, that
is a situation still to be encountered more frequently
than is desirable, even in Lichfield, and it is the reason
that I too am on my way to Antan. I am stopping
here just for the week-end. Yet I still do not know
what in the world you gentlemen really desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For one, I desire nothing that is in this world,”
replied Odysseus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, do you but answer me this very simple question!
What do you three expect to find in Antan? Because
I can assure you that, after the impending
changes to be made in the government and other civic
affairs of Antan by the Lord of the Third Truth,—a
deity, gentlemen, with several not uninteresting aspects,
a deity with whom I may without boasting say
that I have considerable influence,—why, then, the
moment everything is in tolerable working order, it
will be a real pleasure to afford you three gentlemen
all possible courtesies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the three mages did not seem impressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wise,” said Solomon. “I knew all things
save one thing. I did not know that word which was
in the beginning, and which will be when all else has
perished. And that word no god knows until he has
heard it spoken by the Master Philologist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My desire,” said Merlin, “was for the maid
Nimuë and for the love of my child mistress. When
I had my desire it did not content me. So I now go
into Antan to find, it may be, something which I can
desire. But my father’s son does not go asking favors
of any god.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “Yet, you three mages who
have traveled through the Marches of Antan
wherein only two truths endure, and the one
teaching is that we copulate and die,—do you not
look to find in the goal of all the gods some third
truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it seemed to him that the faces of these myths
had now become somewhat evasive and more wary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they said only, speaking severally: “A wise
man knows that no truth is affected either by his beliefs
or by his hopes.”—“A wise man accepts each
truth as it is revealed to him.”—“A wise man will
risk nothing upon the existence of any truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, gentlemen, these are enigmas! These sayings
are not a plain answer to a plain question: and
I do not quite understand these sayings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They answered him, “There is no need that you
should understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then these three passed down toward the sunset
statelily. And Gerald, gazing after them, once more
shook his red head. These wise myths seemed to him
in a bad way: it would not be easy to content the
more eminent sages among his future subjects,
because these three at least, for all their wisdom, appeared
never to have found out what they wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald shrugged. He, in any event, perfectly well
knew what in this bracing country air he wanted
at once. So Gerald went in at once to supper with
his Maya who was such an excellent cook in her
plain way.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch32'>32.<br> <span class='sub-head'>A Boy That Might As Well Be</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“W</span></span>HAT more is needed,” Maya had asked,
“to make this last day with me pass
pleasantly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—For this, again, was the very last day which
Gerald could possibly spend in the trim log and plaster
cottage. Maya had decided, without any reticence,
that it was high time he attended to whatsoever
foolishness he seemed to think himself committed to,
in that disreputable low place down yonder, and that
to keep putting it off in this way looked like shirking,
and that, for her part, she simply could not understand
why he did not get his nonsense over with....</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said, “It would be nice if we had a
son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Maya at once dissented, as, it seemed to Gerald
she nowadays dissented, at least in part, from
everything that Gerald proposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Gerald,” said Maya. “For you would grow
far too fond of him. You would be foolish about him.
You would be unwilling to leave him, you probably
never would leave him. And it would end in your
being in my way, and bothering me in the night
season, and being under my feet all day, for the rest
of your life—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am a god—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Gerald, to be sure, you are. I had forgotten.
I apologize. Now, do not be upset about it! Stop
pouting! You are a god, that is quite understood.
You are immortal, you are going to outlive me indefinitely,
and you are going to perform wonders in
Antan, and it is all going to be very nice. I hope so,
anyhow. I was only saying it would be much better
for us to have no son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerald answered: “Do not keep contradicting
me in that maddening way! If you again fly out
at me like that, Maya, you will rouse my temper.
Then I shall rage and roar and, quite possibly, ramp.
I will bluster and speak harshly. I will huff, I will
puff, I will blow the house down. For I insist it would
be quite nice if we had a son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well, then!” said Maya; and she turned
with that sulkiness which she ever and again displayed—nowadays,—toward
a large basket of
magics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—I mean, though, once he were old enough.
Babies are too limited in conversation, they are too
vocal, and they are too leaky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maya had lifted from an amber basin a small
shining lizard. She held it toward her mouth, breathing
softly upon the creature, in the while that she
answered Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, myself,” said Maya, “that, since you insist
upon having a son, he might as well be seven or
eight years old to begin with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Maya took off the top of the basket, she
reached far into the blue basket with the hand in
which she held the shining lizard, and out of this
basket, clinging to Maya’s hand for support, climbed
a freckled red-haired boy, about eight years old, in
blue garments, and having as yet only one upper
front tooth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have now got a splendid son,” said Gerald,
contentedly. “But who is to christen our son? For I
shall of course call him Theodorick Quentin, just as
my father and my oldest brother were called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was, thus, named Theodorick Quentin
Musgrave, and Gerald delighted in the child. For
the Lord of the Third Truth put off once more his
entry into his kingdom....</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you so!” said Maya.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, really now, my darling, would you have
me lacking in all proper paternal feeling! It is necessary
I give the child a fair start in life; and I
ask you, candidly, could any parent discharge that
duty, with any real thoroughness, in less than a
week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, though, is not at all what I said. And for
any full-grown man to be talking such nonsense—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So now you see for yourself! Therefore I shall
be leaving you both next Tuesday, and it is quite useless
for you to implore me to stay a half-second
longer than that. Besides, I rather like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the child showed peculiarities. For one thing,
his tongue had no red in it, but was formed of perfectly
white flesh. When Gerald noticed this odd fact
he said nothing about it, though, because Gerald comprehended
the limitations of gray magic. And for
another thing, on the third day of Theodorick’s existence,
Gerald happened to lay aside his rose-colored
spectacles while he was playing with his son. Then
the boy was not there. Gerald shrugged, just in time
to avoid shuddering. He replaced his spectacles, and
all was as before, to every freckle and each red hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that, Gerald wore his spectacles always.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Theodorick Quentin Musgrave had become
very dear to him. No more than any other father
could Gerald rationally explain this dearness or
justify it by any common-sense logic. He only knew
that the brat aroused in him a tenderness which came
appreciably near to being unselfish; that it worried
him to have the brat go unchristened in this neighborhood
so full of sorcerers and wizards; that when
he touched the brat it pleased him, for no assignable
reason; and that when the brat displayed the mildest
gleam of intelligence, it at once seemed quite brilliant
and profound, and inexpressibly beyond all other
people’s children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Theodorick noticed everything. And Gerald
delighted particularly in the child’s intelligence and
powers of observation, because, since no sort of
cleverness could possibly be inherited from poor dear
stupid Maya, all the boy’s more excellent mental
traits were obviously paternal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For example, “There is a lady,” Theodorick had
stated, pointing toward Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, any number of ladies, my son,” Gerald assented,
as he thought of the many beautiful goddesses
and feminine myths who (for all that, he reflected,
he had never seen any female creature pass
toward Antan) must be aiding to make yet more
glorious that kingdom over which Gerald would by
this time next week be ruling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald’s hand went to the shoulder of the
freckled brat whom, after next week, he would not
ever be seeing any more: and Gerald wondered at
the wholly illogical pleasure he derived just from
touching this child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, there are no doubt a great many ladies
in Antan,” said Gerald, “and the coincidence is
truly quaint that I have not yet seen any woman
traveling in that direction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the boy explained he meant the very large lady
lying down over yonder as if she were dead, but not
dead, because her heart was breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald saw that, in point of fact, the hills
toward the southwest had, from this station, the
shaping of a woman’s body. She seemed to lie flat
on her back, with her long hair outspread everywhither
about her head, of which the profile, now
that you look for it, was complete and quite definitely
formed. Also you saw her throat and her high breasts,
whence the hills sloped downward into the contour
of a relatively smallish, flat belly. Just here the outline
of the vast violet-tinted figure was broken by
the nearer green hill immediately across the road
which led to Antan, but all that you could see of
this womanlike figure was complete and perfectly
moulded. Moreover, Gerald noted that, near where
the heart would have been, a forest fire was sending
up its languid smoke, which was, of course, what
Theodorick Quentin Musgrave had meant by saying
that the lady’s heart was breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald was very proud of Theodorick’s cleverness
in noticing the shaping of these hills, which Gerald
himself had not ever observed, in the entire three
weeks he had spent upon Mispec Moor. But when
this odd accident of nature was pointed out to Maya,
she only said that she saw what you meant of course,
but that, after all, it was only two hills, and that hills
looked much more like hills than they looked like
anything else.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch33'>33.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Limitations of Gaston</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>I</span></span>T WAS at this time, toward the middle of June,
that Gaston Bulmer came from Lichfield. Gerald
was sitting, as was his daily custom now, under
the chestnut-tree beside the road which led to Antan.
He waited there to engage in conversation the next
of his future subjects who might pass by in that perpetual
journeying toward Antan. Gerald, under this
same chestnut-tree, had by this time talked with many
such unearthly wayfarers: and if the rather interesting
things they had told him were all written down,
it would make a book unutterably enormous and utterly
incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In such circumstances it was, just after two not
unfamiliar mountebanks had gone by carrying with
them the paraphernalia of their Punch and Judas
show, that Gerald noticed a small sulphur-colored
cloud sweeping rapidly from the east. It descended:
and when it was near to Gerald, it unclosed. Gaston
Bulmer then stepped, a bit rheumatically, from its
glowing depths, and he laid down a rod of cedar
wood tipped with an apple carved in blue-stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not in all this anything in itself astonishing,
since Gaston Bulmer was an adept in the arts
of which Gerald, in the strange days before he knew
that he was a god, had been a student. But to note
how Gaston had aged in the last week or so was
astounding. Yet Gerald, in any case, was wholly delighted
to see again his old friend and preceptor, and
a person who had for so long been virtually his
father-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston would not come up to the cottage, though,
for dinner, because, as he confessed, he preferred
not to encounter Maya. Rather, it was his wish, and
it seemed, indeed, to be his errand, to free Gerald
from what Gaston Bulmer, surprisingly enough,
described as the wise woman’s pernicious magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said: “Oh, bosh! For really now, Gaston,
if such nonsense were not heart-breaking it would be
side-splitting. I am inexpressibly shocked by your
hallucination, which is, I trust, of a most transitory
nature. However, let us not discuss my wife, if you
please. Instead, do you tell me how my body is
faring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they sat down together under the chestnut-tree.
And Gaston Bulmer answered, “That body,
Gerald, since you quitted it, has become a noted
scholar and a man of letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! ah!” said Gerald, greatly pleased, “so
my romance about Dom Manuel of Poictesme has
been completed, and is now being admired everywhere!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, for your body has become, just as I said,
a scholar. Scholars do not write romances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you referred to a man of letters—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your body is now a rather famous ethnologist.
Your body deals with historical and scientific truths.
Your body thus writes large quartos upon topics to
which no romance, howsoever indelicate, could afford
to devote a sentence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald fell to stroking that long chin of his.
“Still, I recall that the present informant of my
body once informed me there were only two truths
of which any science could be certain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what were these two truths?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald named them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston said then: “The demon is consistent. For
these two are precisely your body’s scientific specialty.
To-day your body writes invaluable books
in which the quaint and interesting customs that accompany
an interplay of these two truths, and the
various substitutes for that interplay, are catalogued
and explained, as these customs have existed
in all lands and times. Lichfield to-day is wholly
proud of the scholarship and the growing fame of
Gerald Musgrave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad that my body has turned out so splendidly.
And I trust that all goes equally well with
your daughter Evelyn?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gerald,” the older man replied, looking more
seriously troubled than Gerald ever liked to have
anybody seeming in his company, “Gerald, it is an
unfair thing that your Cousin Evelyn, without knowing
it, should be living upon terms of such close
friendship with a demon-haunted body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, so that friendship continues!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It continues,” said Gaston, “unaltered. It may
interest you, Gerald, by the way, to hear that your
Cousin Evelyn has now a son, quite a fine red-headed
boy, born just a year after you relinquished your
body to that treacherous Sylan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald answered affably: “Why, that is perfectly
splendid! Frank always wanted a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son-in-law, in fact, is much pleased. It is
about my daughter I was thinking. It seems to me
the situation is hardly fair to her, Gerald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald replied: “My body is all of me that she
was ever acquainted with, Gaston. So I fail to perceive
that anything is altered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, when I reflect that a beautiful and accomplished
and chaste gentlewoman, Gerald—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ah! But, yes, to be sure! you speak in the
time-hallowed terms of Lichfield. And I really do
not know why I interrupted you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—When I reflect that, without knowing it, a
gentlewoman is living upon terms of such close
friendship with a mere demon-haunted body—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is, in fact, trusting and giving all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All her friendship and the natural affection of a
kinswoman. Yes, that is a sad spectacle. It is an unsuitable
spectacle. So it seems to me your duty as a
Musgrave, and as a Southern gentleman, to return
forthwith to mortal living and to your mortal obligations,
and in particular to the obligations of your
life-long friendship with your Cousin Evelyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said, for the second time, “Oh, bosh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the notions and the chivalrous assumptions of
Gaston Bulmer all now appeared to Gerald out of
reason, in view of the divine predestination which
was upon him. A god had no concern with such slight
imbroglios as the code of a merely terrestrial gentleman
and the proper maintenance upon Earth of
polite adultery. It would, indeed, be positively ill-bred
for a Dirghic god to meddle with any of the
affairs of a planet which, according to Gerald’s
Protestant Episcopal faith, had been created and
was controlled by an Episcopalian deity; for Gerald
had of course retained, provisionally, that religion
in which he was a communicant until he could find
out something rather more definite about the religion
in which he was a god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald therefore said: “My good Gaston, that
your meaning is excellent, I do not doubt. And it is
not your fault of course that, in your merely human
condition, you do not quite understand these matters,
and certainly cannot view them with an omniscient
eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man said: “I understand, in any event,
that through all these years you have stayed here
bewitched with terrible half-magics, and that your
own eyes are blinded with the woman’s rose-colored
spectacles. And I seek to preserve you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would preserve me for the provincial life
of your little Lichfield! You would make me just
another chivalrous, bull-headed, rather nice-looking
and wholly stupid Musgrave! In fine, you would
urge me to become genteel and to deny my glorious
destiny. Yet to do that would be cowardly, Gaston:
for, whether I like it or not, there is upon me the
divine obligation to fulfil some very ancient prophecies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of prophecies are these?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are Dirghic prophecies. But, then, it is
not the language in which a prophecy is uttered that
matters, rather it is—Well, it is the spirit of the
thing! For you must know—although, in view of
my wife’s social position, I have compelled her,
after some little argument, to introduce me hereabouts
as a visiting sorcerer,—yet I may tell you,
in strict confidence, Gaston, it is decreed that, as the
Lord of the Third Truth, I am to reign in Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who told you any such unlikely nonsense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people that I met upon the road. Oh,
quite honest looking people, Gaston!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who told you that you were the Lord of
any Third Truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There my authority is unimpeachable. For I
had it from the lips of a beautiful and accomplished
and chaste gentlewoman, Gaston, who was speaking
with all the frankness begotten by our being in bed
together at the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how can you reign in Antan, or anywhere
else, when you do not ever go there? Through all
these years, I gather, you have loitered here within
a man’s arm’s reach of Antan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said, with the slight frown of one who
finds trouble uncongenial: “I am puzzled, my dear
friend, by your continued references to all these
years. And I admit that various matters have a bit
hindered my technical and merely formal entry into
my kingdom. Yet I shall be leaving Mispec Moor
the instant that this week’s washing is in, on Thursday
afternoon—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my poor Gerald! you will not go, either
forward to Antan or back to Lichfield, on what you
think to be next Thursday. You have lost here all
sense of time, you do not even know that the days
you have spent in this place have counted as four
years in Lichfield. I tell you that the wise woman,
with her half-magics and her accursed spectacles,
holds you here bewitched. And I now perceive that
nothing whatever can be done for you, who are ensnared
by the most fatal of all the magics of the
wrinkled goddess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>—To which Gerald, for the third time, replied:
“Oh, bosh! No sorceress has any power over a god.
And so completely do you misunderstand my wife,
Gaston, that I must tell you hardly a day passes
without her urging me to hurry on to Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaston Bulmer was still regarding him with that
extraordinary and wholly uncalled-for look of compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How completely,” he remarked, “she understands
you Musgraves! Yes, you are lost, my poor
Gerald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—It follows that your notions are preposterous.
Oh, that is not your fault, my dear fellow, and
not for an instant am I blaming you. Your conduct,
from your human point of view, is very right, very
friendly, very proper. So your rather laughable
blunder does not offend me in the least. And if, as
you declare, I have lingered here for some four
years as you human beings estimate time, what do
four years amount to with an immortal who has at
his disposal all eternity? Come now, Gaston, do you
but answer me that very simple question!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gaston answered only: “You are content.
You are lost.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch34'>34.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Ambiguity of the Brown Man</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>ND Gaston said no more about the matter,
because just here their talking was interrupted.
For now, as these two still sat at
the roadside, they were joined by a brown man,
dressed completely in neat brown, who was journeying
toward Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hail, friend!” said Gerald, “and what business
draws you to the city of all marvels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the brown man, pausing, said that, in point
of fact, it was upon a slight matter of business
routine that he desired to consult with Queen Freydis.
All gods, he said, had rather speedily passed
downward to encounter the word which was in the
beginning,—for it was thus that the brown man
spoke, very much as King Solomon had spoken,—all
gods, that is, save only one, who so bewilderingly
altered his tenets that there was no telling where to
have him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brown man thought that, nowadays, in a
comparatively enlightened nineteenth century, was
perhaps the appropriate time for something to be
done about this celestial chameleon. And in any case,
he said yet further, he always enjoyed his little conferences
with Freydis, who was rather a dear—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, so!” said Gerald, “you, sir, have previously
visited Antan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very often. For I am the adversary of all
the gods of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald viewed with natural interest the one
person who pretended to know at first-hand anything
about Gerald’s appointed kingdom: yet, even so,
if this brown gentleman, as Gerald had begun to
suspect, happened to be the Father of All Lies, there
was no real point to questioning him, inasmuch as
you could believe none of his answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—For, I infer,” said Gerald, “that you who
travel on the road of gods and myths are that myth
not unfamiliar to my Protestant Episcopal rearing;
and that I have now the privilege, so frequently anticipated
for me by my nearer relatives, of addressing
the devil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I retain of course in every mythology, including
the Semitic, my niche,” replied the brown man,
“from which to speak to intelligent persons in somewhat
varying voices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gaston Bulmer arose, and the aging adept
shaped a sign which to Gerald was unfamiliar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suspect, sir,” said Gaston Bulmer, “that my
mother’s father, who was called Florian de Puysange,
once heard the speaking of that voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a tenable hypothesis. I in my day have
spoken much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—As did, I believe, yet another forebear of
mine, the great Jurgen, from whom descends the
race of Puysange, and who once encountered someone
rather like you in a Druid wood—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot deny it. The Druids also knew me. I,
who am the Prince of this world, meet however, as
you will readily understand, so many millions of
people during the course of my efforts to keep them
contented with my kingdom that it is not always
possible for me to recollect every one of my beneficiaries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still,” Gerald said, “you have played in large
historical events a strange high part; you have
known all the very best people: and you must have
much of interest to tell me about. You, sir, at least
shall dine with me, since my friend here is obdurate.
My wife avoids the usual run of gods, but to devils
I have never heard her voice the slightest objection.
So, if you will do me the honor to accompany me to
my temporary home, in that cottage—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the brown man smiled. And he excused himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your wife and I are not wholly strangers.
And the circumstances in which we last parted were,
I confess, a bit awkward. So I really believe it would
be more pleasant, for everyone concerned, for me
not to meet your wife just now. Do you present,
none the less, my compliments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And whose compliments shall I tell her that
they are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you say a friend of her earliest youth passed
by, one somewhat intimately known to her before
she first became a mother; and I make no doubt that
Havvah will understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my wife’s married name is Maya, and before
our marriage it was Æsred—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes!” the brown man said, precisely as
Glaum had done, “women do vary in their given
names. Do you present my compliments, then, to
your wife: for that word, by and by, means the
same thing to every husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will convey the message,” Gerald promised:
“but the aphorism I would prefer to have delivered
by somebody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he so parted with both his guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Gaston Bulmer embraced Gerald and then
went sorrowfully back to Lichfield, in a cloud which
the aging adept’s despondency made quite black:
and the brown man leisurely strolled on toward
Antan, with the ease of one who was well used to
walking to and fro about the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not hurry, nor did he look inquisitively
about him, Gerald noticed, as has done the other
travelers toward the city of all marvels. The brown
man, alone of the many that had passed toward
Antan, appeared to travel upon a road with which
he was thoroughly acquainted, toward a familiar
goal.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch35'>35.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Of Kalki and a Döppelganger</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>S</span></span>O IT was that Gerald stayed yet a while longer
upon Mispec Moor. July passed uneventfully.
Each pleasant summer day found Gerald sitting
beneath his chestnut-tree at the roadside: and
he talked there with many wayfarers who have no
part in this tale. For almost all these travelers told
the same story. Nine out of every ten of them had
yesterday been a god whom human beings served;
each had been worshipped by mankind in one or
another quarter of the world: to-day their human
concerns were over, and they journeyed toward the
goal of all the gods. What did they look to find
there? Gerald would ask: and—to this very simple
question,—every one of them replied evasively.
They went to hear that word which was in the beginning,
and which would be after everything else
had perished, that word which was unknown to all
the gods of men. They would say no more: and
Gerald did not deeply bother about the matter, because
he was nowadays quite well contented, and
when he went to Antan would soon be clearing up
every mystery for himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the divine steed Kalki also appeared content
enough, nor was his aspect altered by inaction. The
horse retained that uniform strange shining and
that metallic glitter which made him seem actually
to be made of untarnished silver. Of course when
you saw him grazing upon Mispec Moor just
after a rain-shower his back would be dark and
sleek, and his broad sides would be streaked with
wavering, oily-looking bands. But at all other
times he kept his glowing silver color, which was
unlike that of any other horse Gerald had ever
seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the divine steed grazed with the geldings
who once had been the human lovers of Maya.
He went as they did, lifting each hoof with somewhat
droll carefulness as he grazed forward on the
sloping ground about the cottage. For Gerald would
often watch this grazing. And to him these horses
as they moved slowly and irregularly windward
seemed continually to pick up and to replace their
hoofs upon the ground as though they believed each
hoof to be a rather fragile parcel. The pendulous,
stretched, heavy necks of these horses, each neck
staying always monotonously parallel to all the
other necks, appeared to him too heavy ever again
to be lifted erect. To wonder in the drowsy summer
afternoon how this lifting could possibly be achieved
aroused an unpleasant sensation in Gerald’s collarbone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Kalki fed all day among the geldings, and on
windy nights he huddled with them in the lee of the
cottage. Each day Kalki went looking downward,
grazing interminably, and without ever ceasing to
move those wobbling, dark, prehensile, rotatory,
snuffling lips as the divine steed fed upon the sparse
grass of Mispec Moor. He, just as greedily as the
geldings, would contort his lips and twist his head
when he attempted to get at the longer and more
luscious grass which grew almost inaccessibly about
the fence posts. And to reflection there was something
of the incongruous in the spectacle of a divine
steed engrossed by this problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and again, as Gerald noted also, the stallion
would raise his superb head, and Kalki would look
almost wistfully toward Antan. But soon he would
be back at his grazing: and, upon the whole, he
seemed content enough with the pleasures appropriate
to ordinary horses. And Gerald thought too
that, nowadays, Kalki looked less often toward the
goal of all the gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Kalki turned out to be not wholly unique.
For, one morning, as Gerald went toward his
chestnut-tree, he noted the approach from afar of
a traveler who rode upon a horse that had very
much the appearance of Kalki. And when Gerald
had reached the roadway he saw that the newcomer
was in fact mounted upon a steed which might well
have been Kalki’s twin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hail, friend!” said Gerald, “And what business
draws you to the city of all marvels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a regrettable thing happened; for the young
horseman pretended not to have heard Gerald, and
as the boy passed he looked investigatively about
Mispec Moor, and he pretended not to have seen
Gerald, who stood within a few feet of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a notably handsome boy, too, in a blue
coat and a golden yellow waistcoat, with a tall white
stock and ruffles about his throat. His hair seemed
red: and Gerald noted, moreover, the lazy and
mildly humorous, half-mocking gaze with which this
boy regarded Mispec Moor, as he rode by unhurriedly
toward Antan, without any pausing, and Gerald
noted in particular the very lovely smiling of this
boy’s so amply curved and rather womanish mouth,
as the boy went by upon the horse which was astonishingly
like Kalki.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, he had quite the air of a gentleman: and it
was a great pity that this young whippersnapper had
not the manners of a gentleman also, Gerald reflected,
as Gerald stood there, feeling unwarrantably
snubbed, and blinking behind his rose-colored spectacles.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch36'>36.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Tannhäuser’s Troubled Eyes</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>A</span></span>ND upon yet another day Gerald talked with
the comely but now aged knight Tannhäuser,
as this famous myth passed by, in full armor,
upon his journey into Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said Tannhäuser, “there I may find
again, it may be, the fair Dame Venus and all the
brave and high-hearted sinners who would not compromise
with the narrow and cruel ways of respectable
persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” said Gerald, mildly, “there is considerable
virtue to be found, here and there, among
respectable persons. There is even a virtue in compromise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Tannhäuser shouted: “That I deny! All
my life denies that, and so long as my name lives I
am that lie’s denial! For it was the good and the
respectable who betrayed me. I found pride and
worldliness and a lack of cordiality to exist among
the bourgeoisie and even among those professional
churchmen who should have been the first to sustain
and guide a repentant sinner. And so I turned again
to that frankly pagan beauty which is hateful to
pious and small-minded persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then this resplendent gray-haired myth spoke
heatedly of his own life history and of how his love
for this frankly pagan beauty had led him into the
hollow mountain called the Hörselberg, to live there
as the lover of Dame Venus in all manner of frankly
pagan pleasure-seeking; and of how, after seven
years of frankly pagan recreations, when repentance
smote him, abetted by the frailties of middle age,
it was among the leading church members, and in
the heart of the very head of the church, that he
had found no sympathy. Therefore Tannhäuser was
returning to those frankly pagan recreations, so far
at least as they were consistent with late middle life,
because he was disgusted by those whining and hypocritical,
cruel church members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald listened. He remembered how in the
Mirror of Caer Omn he for a while had been Tannhäuser.
Yet it was a queer thing, and a circumstance
which made Gerald suspect time to be changing him,
somehow, who used to be such a tremendous iconoclast,
that now this old rebellious myth,—which
represented yet another of Gerald’s discarded personalities,—appeared
to Gerald remarkably over-colored
and rather pitiably foolish. For here was
a story which led to wrong conclusions. It ended by
depicting a god at loggerheads with the head of his
own church: and it begot, somewhat inevitably,
those loud sneers at the bourgeois virtues, and those
denunciations of people who, after all, had done
nothing worse than to live quiet and common-sense
lives which Tannhäuser was now declaiming, and
which to Gerald appeared unutterably childish.
There was no conceivable reason why a well-thought-of
pope should be hobnobbing with and
coddling a broken-down old lecher just come out of
a superior brothel. In fact, in reproving Pope Urban
so publicly, Heaven had been, to Gerald’s finding,
rather tactless, and had violated the <span class='it'>esprit de corps</span>
which ought to be preserved among the fellow
workers in every church. And in any case, Tannhäuser’s
present reflections upon religion were not
such as Gerald, now that he had become a god, could
listen to with approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, Gerald did listen: and Gerald smiled, friendlily
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, I know!” said Gerald. “I know, friend,
all about you. When you repented of evil-doing,—and,
really, you did take your time about that,—then
you turned hopefully to religion, but, alas! you
were repelled by its ministers. You found them to be
human beings subject to human frailties. You found
that—in Heaven’s eyes, anyhow,—even a pope
might make a mistake. And so, quite naturally, you
proceeded to drown the surprise and horror
awakened by this discovery in out-and-out debauchery
and in cutting reflections upon all pew-renters.
For your discovery was revolutionary; no
doubt the stars were shaken in their courses, to
observe a human being making a mistake; and you
also must have found the spectacle extremely trying.
Still, you in this way became useful to romantic art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “Lord, man, but what a following
you have had! and what a number of people
have got harmless pleasure out of developing the
discovery which Tannhäuser first made, that inconsistency
and mean-spiritedness may be found among
the clergy and the churchgoers! You will thus continue
to be a benefactor of your kind for centuries,
I have not a doubt. Yet I sometimes fancy that inconsistency
and mean-spiritedness may be found even
among recognizedly depraved persons who do not
go to any church at all. I find that every religion
cows a number of its devotees into a thrifty-minded
practice of generally beneficent virtues. The average
of desirable qualities in the congregation of
every church appears to me, after all, quite perceptibly
higher than is that average among the regular
customers of any brothel or the clients of the public
hangman. I do not deny that my discovery also is,
from any æsthetic standpoint, revolutionary. I confess
that it is nowhere represented in romance, as yet,
and that no conceivable realist can ever regard such
a grotesque fancy with anything save loathing. But
I believe that some day an intrepid handling of this
daring theme will prodigally repay some very great
innovator, and will become useful to romantic art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said also: “Moreover, you remain
quite invaluable as a pretext and a palliation whenever
youth hungers for its fling. Only, I must dare
point out, my dear sir, that your second century-long
fling was, by the best people, unavoidably, felt
to be excessive. All of us, more or less, have had our
flings: even so, a fling needs to be conducted, and
above all to be wound up, with some discretion. It
ought to be high-hearted and lyrical in every feature:
it ought especially to have the briefness of the
lyric. And it ought not, no, it really ought not, to
wind up in the Hörselberg. Now I, too, my friend,
for example, have had my fling. But I have had it
in a quiet, self-controlled and gentlemanly way,
without overdoing the thing. Thereafter I settled
down,—just temporarily, to be sure, but still I have
settled down,—in no lewd and feverish Hörselberg,
but here, where a contented husband risks no further
chance of becoming useful to romantic art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is possible for one to exist, but not for anybody
to live, here!” replied Tannhäuser, scornfully,
as his wild gaze swept over the still stretches of Mispec
Moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allow me!” said Gerald, with the tiniest of
smiles; and he perched his rose-colored spectacles
upon the beaked high nose of Tannhäuser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause. And Tannhäuser sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said the knight then, “a quiet little
home of your own, in the country, with your wife
and with the kiddies, too, I daresay. And with
fresh vegetables, of course, right out of your own
garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In just such a home, Messire Tannhäuser, as is
the cornerstone of every nation, the cradle of all
the virtues, and the guiding-star of I forget precisely
what. It is also the brightest jewel in the crown of
something or other, and it assists other desirable
abstractions in the capacity of a bulwark, a spur,
and an anchor. It is, you may depend upon it, the
proper place in which to end one’s fling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I! I might, if only I had married that dear
fine sweet girl Elizabeth, I, too, might have had
such a home! For, after all, there is nothing like
marriage and the love of a good woman. An endless
round of perpetual pleasure-seeking rings hollow
by and by, and one hungers for the simple sacred
joys of home-life. I must, oh, very decidedly, I must
settle down. I, too, must have just such a home as
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the thought of all which he had been missing
so affected Tannhäuser that he took off the spectacles
and unaffectedly wiped his eyes. After that
the aging, comely knight sat for a while silent and
rather frightened looking. He stared again at the
cottage and at the moor, and then he stared at
Gerald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you live in this hole, with a muddy brat and
a dull-witted, middle-aged, not at all good-looking
woman for your only company! I marvel at the
enchantment which controls you. At least Dame
Venus held me with an intelligible sort of sorcery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” Gerald replied, as he contentedly put on
his rose-colored spectacles again, “is nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very dreadful nonsense. It is a soul-destroying
and besotting nonsense, from which I
flee to look for the less terrible enchantments of the
Hörselberg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald put his question. “You, who have
traveled through the Marches of Antan, wherein
only two truths endure, and the one teaching is that
we copulate and die,—do you not look to find in the
goal of all the gods some third truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the comely knight seemed not to have heard
this question, in his frank terror of domesticity.
Tannhäuser had mounted his horse, and he now rode
galloping like a madman toward Antan.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch37'>37.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Contentment of the Mislaid God</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>N</span></span>OW life contented Gerald as he lived it
through this recognized parenthesis in his
divine career. Very soon this little episode
of his stay upon Mispec Moor would be ended: it
would even be forgotten, perhaps, in the press of
regal and superhuman affairs. Meanwhile he lived
in quite tolerable ease. He had nothing to trouble
him. Hardly a morning passed without his finding
some more or less interesting celestial outcast to
talk to under his chestnut-tree. Maya continued to
be an excellent cook, in her plain, unpretentious
way: and she saw to it that the cottage was kept
comfortable and efficient in all appointments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Maya was dear to him. She nowadays found
fault with virtually everything that Gerald did. And
whenever he ventured any suggestion, as to Theodorick
or the economics of the cottage or their social
engagements in Turoine,—or even if Gerald as
much as suggested opening or closing a window,—Maya
at once produced at least nine grounds upon
which the suggestion was plainly very foolish and
would never have occurred to anyone of real intelligence.
And she cherished the most imaginative views
as to the extent of Gerald’s selfishness and lack of
consideration for other people, and of his habit of
never doing anything whatever for her pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, though, she would go for as much as
an hour without dwelling, at especial length, upon
what a trial Gerald was to her in one way or another.
And in all respects she was a capable woman who
made him an excellent wife, and treated him far
better than she could have found any excuse for doing
in what she said about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald loved Theodorick Quentin Musgrave,
also, with an affection which rather troubled
Gerald. The child, he knew, displayed no extraordinary
charm nor talent: no course of reasoning
could justify any extreme fondness for Theodorick
upon the ground of his physical or mental gifts.
Theodorick Quentin Musgrave was not brilliant,
he was not lovely, he was not especially amiable: he
was, indeed, by way of being a particularly selfish
small tyrant, continually adding to the disorder of
the cottage, to the dismay of Gerald’s finicky liking
for neatness, and continually devising unneeded
trouble and commandeering manual tasks from his
parents because of the droll pleasure which Theodorick
appeared to derive from seeing his parents
fetch and carry in his service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, whensoever Gerald put his arm about the
small, warm, yielding, sturdy, but so helpless body,
it was as though Gerald’s own body were melting in
a grateful glow of what was—bewilderingly—a
sort of panic terror. He loved this freckled, fragile
creature with an unwisdom which was, as Gerald
knew, an assuredness of more or less future discomfort
and, it well might be, of anguish, for him who
quite honestly disliked trouble of any kind. Since
this child had been created, Gerald’s well-being was
not any longer a matter which Gerald could hope to
control or even to protect: his happiness was now
risked upon what might befall this imp. It was the
helplessness of the child which frightened Gerald
with a sense of his own helplessness. Life was so
cruel to children. Life damaged and hurt children in
so many ways inevitably. And every hurt to this
child, now, would be an anguish to Gerald, who
could avoid none of them. He could not even manage
to get the child properly christened, in this neighborhood
so profuse in sorcerers and wizards, who used,
as everybody knew, unchristened children in horrible
ways which it was not comfortable to think
about....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, too, Gerald was not certain Theodorick
Quentin Musgrave was real. Gerald remembered
always, at the back of his mind, that frightful instant
when he had removed his spectacles, to find
the child had vanished. Gerald assured himself that
the cause was a slight indigestion, and that the
moment’s blur of vision came from a disordered
stomach. But he was wholly careful not ever again
to look at Theodorick except through the rose-colored
spectacles which made visible the magics of
Maya. He kept resolutely out of his full attention
the fact that Theodorick might be an illusion which
Maya had created. And he grew accustomed to that
unusual milk-colored tongue, which showed like a
white snake within the red moist little mouth whenever
the child laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald sometimes wondered if Maya had
over-ambitiously designed to make permanent this
mere parenthesis in his career. She had attempted,
to be sure, no magic such as that with which she had
transformed his predecessors. No sorceress would
dare, for that matter, thus to presume against a
god.... Gerald knew that, instead, it was his
Maya’s wholesome simplicity and the prosaic human
comfort which he did get, after all, from living with
this middle-aged and fault-finding and not in the
least beautiful woman that had detained him, just
for the while of this parenthesis in his career. He
of course would pass on, to enter into his kingdom,
by and by. And there was no conceivable hurry about
it, now that his journeying to Antan was for every
practical purpose finished, and now that whensoever
he elected he might within the next half-hour or so
be taking over the realm and all the powers of the
Master Philologist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, though, Gerald would now and then
wonder amusedly if his dear, stupid Maya could
perhaps have struck upon the device of detaining
him by not using any magic whatever: if she in secret
flattered herself that this device was succeeding: and
if she actually cherished the delusion that she was
hoodwinking omniscient Fair-haired Hoo, the
Helper and Preserver, the Lord of the Third Truth,
the Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyhow, his life here very amiably contented him
for the while. The local circles of sorcerers and
wizards were pleasant enough, barring only that
haunting memory as to how they used unchristened
children. Gerald and Maya did not go out a great
deal; but they were on friendly terms with the neighbors;
they attended an occasional Sabbat; and they
kept in touch generally with the affairs of Turoine.
And for the rest, the little happenings of his home
life temporarily contented the Lord of the Third
Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he began to reflect that, just possibly, Antan
might be to him, after he had entered into his kingdom,
a disappointment. From here Antan seemed
uniformly wonderful. It was astonishingly pleasant
to sit upon the western porch of the small cottage,
especially toward evening, when your shoes propped
up before you on the porch railing reflected a pinkish
glow from the sunset, and to imagine what was going
on in that broad expanse of yet unvisited fields and
hills which now were turning into gray and purple
mists directly beneath the gold and crimson of the
sunset. The trouble was that you, who were gifted
with the imagination of a god, were very certainly
imagining more wonderful happenings for that mysterious
theatre than could by any chance be enacted
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one matter, after dark, Antan always displayed
eight lights, six of them grouped together in
the middle of the vista with the general effect of
a cross, and the other two showing much farther
off to the northwest. About those never-varying huge
lights Gerald had formed at least twenty delightful
theories, all plausible as long as you remained upon
Mispec Moor, whereas if you went to Antan not
more at most than one of these theories could prove
true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To go to Antan thus meant the destruction of no
less than nineteen rather beautiful ideas as to those
lights alone. However, Gerald felt, there was no
help for this: and he whole-heartedly meant to take
over his appointed kingdom without any unpleasant
criticizing, no matter what might be the deficiencies
of the place, by and by. Meanwhile, there was no
great hurry: and it was, indeed, a prudent and long-sighted
course for him to be pausing here to enjoy
these fine scenic effects, because by and by he
would not ever again be seeing Antan from this
distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After nightfall those eight lights never varied.
But by day there was always a different and, as it
seemed, a more lovely display of rounded, parti-colored,
cleared hills, which here and there were
darklier streaked, no doubt with orchards. Beyond
them many flat-topped mountains showed, yet farther
to the west, like a sleeping herd of gigantic blue
crocodiles all couched across the west and facing
north. And above so much terrestrial graciousness
moved an incessant pageant of clouds, not a bit like
the flat clouds which you looked up at from Lichfield,
because the clouds which brooded over Antan were
seen, from Gerald’s station upon Mispec Moor, as
on a level with you: and, when they were thus considered
sidewise, they resembled moving walls and
crags and drifting curtains through which the sunlight
smote in slanting and huge and pallid and quite
tangible looking shafts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always, too, you noticed, nowadays, that vast and
violet-shrouded, high-breasted woman’s figure lying
yonder, motionless, with that ever-burning heart; and
you were visited by an odd fancy. You fancied that
Queen Freydis, the as yet unwon-to queen of your
appointed kingdom, was like that woman. And this
fancy came to you none the less often because of your
plain perception of its illogic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, now!” said Gerald, “a mistress of that
size would be unsuitable. Charms of so diffuse an
acreage would create, even in a god, a sense of inadequacy.
Nevertheless, I am falling rather ardently
in love with those two hills. I begin to adore the casual
play of lights and shadows upon yonder piled-up
dirt, which when seen from any other station than
this would not in the least resemble a woman. And
such amorous notions, apart from their insanity, are
not befitting in a contentedly, if temporarily, married
person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transience of his comforts made them very
dear. It was well worth the inconvenience of sleeping
in his spectacles (as Gerald, for his own reasons,
did) so that in the night season he could awaken, to
see Maya’s tranquil brown head yonder beside the
smaller and tousled and livelily red head of Theodorick
Quentin Musgrave,—both visible yonder because
of the lamp which the child demanded at night,
and because of his insistence that Mother was to
sleep with him instead of with Father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside, Gerald would hear those of his transformed
predecessors who now were horses, shuffling
and restively stamping, and at times snorting and
whinnying, in the chill outer darkness; or a misguided
gentleman who lived nowadays as a steer would low,
much farther off; or Gerald would hear yet another
one of Maya’s former husbands coughing, with the
far-reaching and morose scornfulness peculiar to a
sheep. And then the difference between the estate of
Gerald’s predecessors and the snug warmth of his so
comfortable soft bed, and his knowledge of that unmarred
bodily ease which, just now, was his through
every hour of the day, would trouble Gerald, because
he knew it all to be so satisfying and so transient.</p>

he did not know how many years in Lichfield. He
would now and then contrast himself with his great
ancestor Dom Manuel, the same about whom, in
that quaint far-off time when Gerald had believed
himself merely human, and was interested in such human
nonsense, Gerald had intended to write a romance,—because
the Redeemer of Poictesme, as
Gerald remembered it, had passed a month with the
wood demon Béda, in the forest of Dun Vlechlan,
where the company consisted entirely of evil principles,
and where the passing of each day left Manuel
a year older.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald would reflect how much more sensible and
pleasant was the course which he was following, surrounded
with every domestic virtue, where the days
did not count at all. For Gerald was content, and
certainly he had grown no older in body. He had become
used to living upon Mispec Moor: he wondered
sometimes if Antan could afford any splendor which
he personally would find more to his taste; and he
felt that he would honestly miss the simple wholesome
ways of Maya’s log and plaster cottage after
he had entered forever into the red-pillared palace
of his kingdom beyond good and evil,—next week,
perhaps, or at all events not later than September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And it stayed diverting to observe those persons
who almost every day passed beyond Mispec Moor
in their journeying toward the goal of all the gods of
men. Then by and by one of these wayfarers turned
out to be a stalwart, white-bearded old gentleman
dressed as a bishop. And the sight of him delighted
Gerald: for here at last was somebody who could
properly christen Theodorick Quentin Musgrave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile this traveler was asking hospitality of
Maya. She, who disliked travelers, prepared the
white and tender flesh of a calf, she kneaded cakes
of fine meal and baked them upon the hearth, she
fetched milk and butter. All these she set before the
seeming bishop upon the front porch of her cottage
quite affably. For this old gentleman, it appeared,
had known Maya of the Fair Breasts a great while
ago, at the very beginning of a career confessedly
so populous in husbands that Gerald always felt a
certain delicacy in asking questions about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there was never any reasoning with you, my
dear,” said the old gentleman, as they all ate amicably
together upon the porch. “So you eluded my
purpose, and you preferred to content that first man
of yours for his loss of the over-wilful beauty and
the rebellious wisdom of your predecessor—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maya replied: “I do wish you would try just one
more of those cakes, for I made them myself, exactly
as you used to like them in the plains of Mamrê,
when you were up to your nonsense with Sarah. Yes,
I believe that a girl, a really nice girl, that is, should
keep her caresses for her husband. Oh, I am casting
no reflections upon either of your sweethearts. It is
a matter every woman must decide for herself. I
merely say that, for my part, I think a love-affair
with a god while he is still in power is ostentatious
and can only end in unhappiness—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—!” Gerald had begun indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She patted his hand. “No, Gerald, I did not mean
you. Your power is limitless, and you are quite different
from all other gods, and nobody knows that
better than I do. So please do not start any pouting
while we have company! He thinks that he is a god,
too,” Maya then stated, casually, to her visitor.
“That is why his feelings are upset. He believes he
is the Fair-haired Hoodoo, the Yelper and the Pretender,
or something of that sort. As for that woman,
Adam was very lucky to get rid of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said the white-bearded gentleman,
smiling reminiscently, “I wonder if he always
thought so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear old friend! but you and I know quite
well what the creatures are! Of course he cherished
the memory of her for the rest of his life, long after
the worthless piece had gone, just literally, to the
devil. She was not bad looking: that much, anyhow,
one can say in her favor: and so the poor fellow had
always his memories of that beauty which he had
known, once. He used to say it was too lovely to be
retained by any man. And I agreed with him. No
man had the least chance, with infernal connoisseurs
about.... And his sons,” said Maya, as she reflectively
scratched at her nose, “have, somehow, all
preserved that memory. There is no one of them but
now and then finds my daughters rather inadequate,
and half remembers that woman and gets lackadaisical
over her. It is just another thing about the creatures
which my daughters have to put up with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She too is yonder, they tell me,”—and the old
gentleman nodded toward Antan. Then he continued:
“And I suspect there is no one of your daughters
but is jealous of this ever-living memory of that
Lilith who stays always the first, never quite forgotten
love of every son of Adam; and who prevents
more of them than you would care to acknowledge,
my dear, from ever utterly giving over their hearts
to any of your daughters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are jealous, within limits,” Maya replied, in
the while that she hospitably refilled his glass with
fresh milk. “No woman likes playing second fiddle,
even in the moonstruck brain of a poet. Yet my
daughters know it does no real harm. And if men
were not up to something, they would be up to something
else. Besides, it gives them their nonsense to
be romantic over in private, without pestering their
poor sweethearts, and their wives too at first, to be
romantic along with them, which is a thing no nice
woman really feels comfortable about—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the old gentleman had sighed. “You touch
upon a somewhat harrowing subject. For I fancy that
no other luckless being has ever had to cater to the
shifting needs of popular romance so arduously or
so variously as I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Maya now was beaming upon him quite
fondly. “Yes, but how clever you have been about
it! In fact, I suppose that nobody anywhere has ever
had a more wonderful career than yours. And it
seems only yesterday—does it not?—that we were
all young together in the Garden, and your reputation
was merely local. But you Jews are so adaptable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not even a Jew, my dear, to begin with.
Perhaps that is why I never quite got on with them.
I was a storm deity of the Midianites. But the Jews
kidnapped me, in some way or another, when I was
just a godling playing happily with my thunderbolts
upon the flanks of Sinai.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so, when I think of what a position you
have attained in the best Christian circles, and of the
perfect respectability of the church to which you now
belong, and of all the splendid poetry you have
inspired, and of how generally famous you have become
everywhere, I am wholly proud that you once,
when we were both younger”—and Gerald saw
that Maya had colored up rather prettily,—“had
other plans for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You,” said the old gentleman,—who, as Gerald
now observed, was really quite Jewish looking,—“were
the first of my disappointments. Yes, I suppose
that in many respects my career has been unusual.
Yet it has ended by placing me in a most
awkward position: and nothing ever turned out in
accordance with my plans, somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the stalwart, white-bearded old gentleman
who was dressed as a bishop spoke of his first family,
and of how his descendants through a son named
Isaac went astray. He spoke of his efforts to retain
the affection of his family, through the vigorous
methods appropriate to a storm god. But nothing
had seemed to avail. There had been fine plagues
and deluges and captivities and decimations and devastating
miracles by the score. He had sent the
swords of Babylon and of Philistia and of dozens of
other kingdoms to slay them, and huge dogs to tear
their corpses, and many birds of prey and all the wild
beasts of earth to devour and to destroy them, without
arousing one ray of real affection. He had laid
waste their cities; he had made their widows as the
sands of the sea; he had starved them, and had smitten
them with leprosy, and had burned them with
lightnings; he had afflicted them with the most voluble
and pessimistic prophets: he had, in a word, done
absolutely everything he could think of as likely to
requicken their waning affection. But the more he
annoyed his descendants, the less they had seemed
really to love him. Upon the heels of every warning,
and immediately after each paternal correction, the
survivors of it seemed only the more inclined to
prefer some other patron: and it was all very discouraging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of his second son he spoke also. Here he
became remarkably vague, and he talked as if muddled
by the whole affair. There had been a great
sacrifice and an atonement, the workings of which
the old gentleman could not pretend to understand.
He could not yet say just who had been put in a more
amiable frame of mind by that atonement, since personally
he imagined any father would have found it
most distasteful and upsetting. Anyhow, the affair
had resulted in a church with which he had felt it
rather his duty to associate himself. And, awkwardly
enough, after he had thus been persuaded by them
formally to commit himself to a policy of peace and
forgiveness and general loving-kindness, his incomprehensible
servants had gone on squabbling and
murdering, only much more often than before, because
now they did it on high moral grounds. They
had fought over transubstantiation, and over Greek
diphthongs, and over the respective merits of complete
and frontal baptism, and over infant damnation,
and over redemption through faith alone, and
over a number of other recondite matters which no
Arabian storm god, very simply reared in the country
during the really formative years of his life, and
with no regular academic training, could well be expected
to understand: and it was all very discouraging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor to-day was his position much happier. He
found himself ranked rather high in the church with
which he was associated professionally. Yes, the old
gentleman admitted, with plain bewilderment, his
name was honored. But all his actions—even such
quite notable actions as holding a conference with
his disciples in a fiery furnace, and affording his messengers
inter-urban transportation by means of a
whale, and of causing the sun itself to stand still,—all
these fine exploits, along with his every natural
exhibition of the irascibility and truculence appropriate
to a storm god, had been reduced to poetic inventions.
His very existence had been complicated
with a triplicity which, since the mind could not
grasp it, prevented his existence from being, actually,
believed in by anybody. That had seemed, from the
first moment he heard of it, a doctrine a bit difficult
for him personally to accept, after having been an
undivided deity in regular practice for so many thousands
of years. And eighteen centuries of pondering
upon that doctrine of his triune nature, to which
he was through his official position committed, had
showed a matter so abstruse and puzzling to be far
beyond the comprehension of any country-bred Arabian
storm god, howsoever faithfully he had broadened
his mind, at the courts of various Christian
monarchs and in the larger nunneries, since the commencement
of his religious training among the farming
element of Seir and Sinai. Nor could he honestly
say that he had ever been able to take quite kindly
to the notion that his being was confessedly a mystery
not to be understood by prelates graduated
from the best seminaries, and that his actions were
all poetic inventions. For that left of him, so far as
could be seen by a plain-thinking Arabian storm god,
nothing which the human mind could grasp as an actuality;
it made every one of his really thorough-going
servants who accepted utterly the teachings of his
church, so far as he could infer, a devotee of vacuousness:
and it was all very discouraging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Altogether,” said the old gentleman who was
dressed as a bishop, “I feel that my present ranking
in the Christian church is a perplexing and, in some
sense, a false position for an Arabian storm god. I
have aged under it. Oh, I have tried to be quite fair
about the matter. Sometimes I even go so far as to
concede that people who have never met a particular
person might, just possibly, believe that person to be
three persons whose actions were all poetic inventions.
The human imagination is vigorous. I must
point out to you, though, my friends, that nobody
could conceivably believe that about himself. These
very curious theories about me thus postulate the existence
of at least one sceptic, and they hinge indeed
upon the existence of that sceptic, in me. Now, I feel
instinctively there must be an error in any such logic.
I feel it unfair that I alone of all the persons connected
with my church should be inevitably doomed
to remain an atheist. And I have aged steadily under
the injustice and unreason of it all. Otherwise, if I
yet retained the vigor of my youth, I might yet, in
my frank way, attempt to clean the slate, as it were,
with whirlwinds and thunderbolts and another deluge
or so, and to make a fresh start all around. But, alas,
I have aged, my dear Havvah, since the days of our
first acquaintance. The inexplicable theology and the
rationalization, as they call it, to which I have been
subjected by my incomprehensible servants, now for
some eighteen centuries with ever increasing rigor,
have brought me to the point that I cannot logically
believe in my own existence. The things they tell me
simply do not hold together. And so—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He comprehensively waved his hand toward
Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerald rose, and Gerald put aside his glass of
milk and his veal sandwich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said, beamingly: “You who have traveled
through the Marches of Antan, wherein only
two truths endure, and the one teaching is that we
copulate and die,—you at least, I know, must, as a
leading official of the Protestant Episcopal church,
look confidently forward to finding in the goal of all
the gods a third truth. The fact emboldens me to ask
that you do but answer me this very simple question—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, my friend,” the badgered looking old gentleman
broke in, “professionally, of course, my faith
is all that it should be. But in my private capacity, as
a plain-thinking Arabian storm god, now that I am
retiring from active churchwork, I suspect that when
anybody anywhere once understands the nature of
any two truths, that will be quite time enough for
him to be requiring a third truth to exercise his wits
upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That truism, sir, is not to be denied,” said Gerald,
rather crestfallen. “Yet that is likewise an evasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact,” said the bewildered old gentleman,
shaking sadly his white head, “in fact, ever since I
acquired triplicity, I have been accused of duplicity
also. The Gnostics, I remember, said very unkind
things about that: the Valentinians were no more
charitable: whereas I would really hesitate to repeat,
my friends, the remarks of the Priscillianists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And in any case,” Gerald said, emphatically,
“howsoever you may evade me, it would not do for
you to evade your duties to the Protestant Episcopal
church. The world as yet has need of bishops and of
all that they signify. I must point out to you, sir, that
the wild talking of bishops yet frightens many persons
into a thrifty-minded practice of generally beneficent
virtues. Indeed, sir, bishops remind me
rather of calomel in the effect which they have upon
the run of men, because I find their effect also to be,
ultimately, beneficial. There are also other points of
resemblance. And if the strange ways of episcopal
action now and then unavoidably upset you, sir, you
ought to remember that it is, after all, for the general
good. I, moreover, must point out that it absolutely
would not do for you to go into Antan and be
one of my subjects—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He thinks,” Maya once more explained, parenthetically,
to her guest, “that he is a god, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am!” said Gerald. “These continual interruptions
are really very awkward, my dear. And
the present situation also is awkward, in view of my
Protestant Episcopal upbringing. It is a situation
which must at any cost be avoided. This gentleman
simply must not go into Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is to be done about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you not be uneasy! Your age, sir, and its
attendant delusions, such as wanting to go into Antan,
are matters quite easily remedied by any competent
Dirghic deity. You could not possibly have
pursued a wiser course than to come to me for assistance.
So, if you will permit me, sir—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter Gerald, still in something of a flutter,
baptized the old gentleman who was dressed as a
bishop with the last remaining drop of water from
the Churning of the Ocean.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch39'>39.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Baptism of a Musgrave</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>F</span></span>ORTHWITH the old white-bearded gentleman
became a most personable looking youngish
Oriental, who shone with a fiery radiance,
and about whose head played a continual flashing
like small lightnings. And he said, approvingly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a fine magic which has restored to me my
youth and the vigorousness I had in Midian before
I was kidnapped by those stiff-necked and unaffectionate
Jews.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you now be going into Antan?” asked
Gerald, rather anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, my friend,” replied the merry, strong,
young Arabian storm god. “Oh, very certainly, not
yet! No, I have had quite enough of my illogical
position as a Christian and of the worries of being
rationalized by incomprehensible foreigners. I shall
thankfully return to my Midianites and to my little
shrines upon Seir and Sinai and Horeb, and to the
quiet living of a local godling. I shall be hearing again
my own people’s sane and intelligible prayers for
rain, and I shall be snuffing up the smoke of such
rational offerings as kids and goats and an occasional
prisoner of war, just as I used to do, where I was
given due credit for my actions, and where you heard
no unpleasant personal scandal circulated about my
being triplets. In the meanwhile, my benefactor, is
there not any favor which, in my turn, I can do
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, my dear sir,” Gerald answered, harking
back to that worriment which in a neighborhood so
full of sorcerers and wizards stayed always in the
rear of Gerald’s mind, “there is a small one, now
you mention it. For we have a boy, as you perceive.
And it occurs to me that this is the first chance to
have Theodorick Quentin Musgrave properly christened
according to the rites of the Protestant Episcopal
church—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm god asked of Gerald, in good-humored
surprise. “But do I now look to you much like an
Episcopalian clergyman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, I admit the situation is perplexing.
Nevertheless, you remain, so far as I can see, one
of the three official heads of the Christian church, in
every denomination. And as such, you must be wholly
competent to administer the sacred rites of that baptism
to which we Musgraves are accustomed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He who had been a bishop laughed again. For
an instant he glanced sidewise at Maya, rather impishly.
Then the god called to him Theodorick Quentin
Musgrave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy came forward without speaking. There
had never been any dearer brat since time began,
Gerald reflected, than was this sturdy droll red-headed
jackanapes who waited there holding his
small chin well up in order to look with politely
puzzled interest at the storm god’s glittering face
and the tiny lightnings which played about it. Gerald
was abeam with the most fatuous sort of pride
in Theodorick’s perfect behavior. Gerald glowed all
over, now that awkward matter of the boy’s christening
was being at last attended to, by the very highest
authority. And Gerald nodded smilingly and with
some inconsequence at his dear stupid Maya, so that
she too might note how splendidly Theodorick was
behaving. The boy was displaying the composure and
the excellent manners of a true Musgrave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the storm god dipped his fingers in his unfinished
glass of milk, and upon Theodorick’s lifted
forehead he drew a sign. Gerald was not wholly certain,
afterward, that it was the sign of a cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is another sort of baptism than that which
restored my youth. For youth this child already has,—to
every seeming,” the god said, a bit unaccountably.
“Therefore I now release this child whom I did
not create, I release him from the bondage of the
woman and of the Adversary who caused him to live
upon this earth. I decree a forgiveness for the seven
crimes. I cry a remission of the seven punishments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must say, though, you have been long enough
about it,” Maya placidly observed....</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Gerald, now that the ceremony was over,
he was unaffectedly hugging Theodorick, and telling
him that he was far too big a boy to be kissing people,
and the vaguely puzzled, clinging child was asking,
But who started it, Father?...</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the storm god was saying to Maya, “Do you
forget, my dear Havvah, that it is from your service
I am releasing him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered, still quite placidly: “So far as that
goes, the imp has well earned a holiday; and it is not
as if I were dependent upon him. No, but I confess
to wondering—and not for the first time, either,—just
what you may be up to.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch40'>40.<br> <span class='sub-head'>On the Turn of a Leaf</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>S</span></span>O THE Oriental storm god went back into the
world of everyday, to look for his old shrines
upon Sinai and Horeb: and Gerald was happily
rid of a future subject whom, he could not but
feel, it would have been a bit awkward to have as a
subject. And the evening passed tranquilly, although
it seemed to Gerald that Theodorick was rather
moody and quiet after his christening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not until the next day that Theodorick,
just after breakfast, spoke with a voice which seemed
to Gerald not quite the voice of a child: and Theodorick
told his parents he wanted to go down into
Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald was troubled. Yet he suggested, with very
careful levity, “If—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please,” the but half-smiling, ugly, so
dear brat now added, docilely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, it must be as your father says,” Maya replied.
She had paused in her sweeping off of the
porch, and for a moment she held the broom slantwise
as she meditated over the boy’s notion. “But,
for one, I see no great harm in your having a little
outing, for I will put a protection on you. Only, you
must promise to be back in good time to have your
face and hands washed for supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said forlornly, “But what are those small
yellow things you are sweeping from the porch, my
dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are fallen leaves from a sycamore-tree, left
here last night by that wind, Gerald: and I really do
wish you would not ask such silly questions, when I
was talking about something quite different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that means summer is ending, Maya. It
means an end of all growing. It means that not
anything now will become any larger or more
lovely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word, but I never did hear of any such
nonsense as you do talk sometimes, for a grown man,
Gerald, as if summer did not always end!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it, precisely. It always ends: and the
warmth and comfort of it perish. Yes, there is death
in the air. I do not find that cheering. And that is
all, my darling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then, Gerald, if you are quite through with
that up-in-the-air sort of talking—which may be
very deep and clever indeed, only I happen not to understand
it, and certainly have no wish to,—why,
then, I was asking you about something entirely
different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you were speaking of Theodorick!
Well, boys do get restless without any playmates,
I suppose. I will talk to him about his notion while
you are making up the beds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could have been more prosaic. Yet Gerald
was troubled. He could hear Maya inside the
cottage, already thumping at the pillows. All about
him seemed matter of fact, and comfortable, and
familiar, and stable. And yet everything, as he somehow
knew, was about to change. There awoke in him
as yet no real unhappiness, but just a faint uneasiness
mixed with resentment, now that he noted the fall of
the first leaf in autumn, and knew he was powerless
to stay the beginning change in everything about his
small, snug home.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch41'>41.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Child of All Fathers</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HEN Gerald followed the child down to
the roadside. And they talked together under
the chestnut-tree, just where Gerald had
talked with so many strange beings who had passed
beyond Mispec Moor in that continuous journeying
toward Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First Gerald performed that needful rite which
would reveal the truth. The child watched quietly.
By and by Theodorick began to smile. But he said
never a word until his father was through with these
droll doings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald questioned his small son. Theodorick
replied. The appearance of a little child still sat
there, and the soft red lips of a child were moving,
but that curious tongue which was like a small white
serpent was speaking about matters never known to
any child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one of Gerald’s excursions into the darker
magics had prepared him for what was now in part
revealed. Something of the spaces outside the world
apparent to human senses Gerald knew, and of the
realms beyond Earth’s orbit he, as a former student
of magic, was not ignorant. But now he understood
from what remote abyss his wife had drawn the being
which seemed his child: a bit unwillingly, he could
even surmise with what kind of enchantments Maya
had fetched this seeming into the happier superficial
world which is apparent to human senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald was moved: he was, as so many husbands
have been, before and since, now almost frightened
by this glimpse of the unswerving and whole-hearted
and unscrupulous love which women nourish
for that man whom marriage has given them to look
after. He was not worthy, he contritely felt, of being
thus idolized and of being coddled at the fearful
price of such unearthly indiscretions. And Gerald was
sincerely touched, now that he comprehended to what
lengths Maya had gone to gratify his whim of wanting
a son, out of hand. She had warned him, too, that
he was contriving for himself grief. Yes, her womanly
intuition had, somehow, foreseen that to which all
his cleverness had been blind. And yet, even so, Maya
had not denied him his desire, because poor Maya
pampered him in everything, to the accompaniment
of a commentary howsoever tart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald thought too of how, a moment since,
his worst dread had been that the boy was an illusion.
He looked at his beloved son, knowing now what inhabited
that freckled and droll, sturdy little body.
The boy had of a sudden become strange; he was
now a threat of unimaginable danger, and a creature
worse than evil: yet Gerald knew, with a dull wonder,
that he loved Theodorick Quentin Musgrave even
now....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald by and by put yet another question to this
dreadful parody of a child’s innocence and helplessness,
to the being whom Gerald invoked as Abdel-Hareth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have served her purpose,—my father,”
the child replied, with a rather perturbing smile.
“Oh, but I know! She has had many husbands. Most
of them desired a son. I have always been that son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after an instant of silence, the being who
was speaking through the child’s dear lips told of
the bonds from which the Midianite storm god’s
touch and absolution had released him. Gerald found
this part of the story particularly unpleasant. And
Theodorick Quentin Musgrave, whom Gerald still
addressed as Abdel-Hareth, went on to tell why he
must now go downward into Antan, to encounter,
not the Master Philologist, but Queen Freydis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald asked, What was needed of Queen Freydis?
The child told him. Then Gerald shivered. He felt,
if only for the instant, physically cold and nauseated.
Still, that this creature should desire to return to its
unearthly home was natural enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I comprehend,” said Gerald. “I comprehend a
great deal which was unknown to me ten minutes ago.
I confess to being surprised by much that I have
learned from you. Nevertheless, my son,—if you
will pardon the force of habit, sir, and the love I
had for my own little, so dear son—! But I drift
into emotional remarks which would be wholly out
of place. My voice, as I note with sincere regret,
evinces a distressing tendency—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald paused. He gulped. He spoke now in a
voice that was light and high-pitched and rather hysterical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fine, my dear Abdel-Hareth, as you see, I incline
somewhat to blubber like a badly whipped baby.
I can but ask you to respect the emotions of a suddenly
bereaved parent, without bothering to understand
his confused utterances. No: you have given
me my desire, and my great happiness. A part of that
dies now. But I have had it, utterly. I am content.
I will see to it that you, in your turn, sir, get what
you desire.”</p>

that Gerald returned to Maya. Nor did it surprise
him she had already prepared a neatly
wrapped up lunch for Theodorick Quentin Musgrave
to be eating that day in Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald said, with painstaking carelessness, “Well,
my dear, after talking the matter over, I have decided
we may as well let the boy go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to be sure!” said Maya. “And a great
deal of bother, too, there has been made this morning
over nothing, as if I did not already have quite
enough to bother me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that, she summoned from among her enchanted
geldings the handsomer of the pair who
formerly had been emperors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a child of mine must go in proper state,”
said Maya.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “No. An imperial steed is well
enough, but a divine steed is better. Let him take
Kalki!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, really, Gerald, your unreasonableness
sometimes surprises even me! For you know perfectly
well that Kalki is your own horse, and that
you will be needing him yourself when you ride down
to the appointed kingdom you are always talking
your stuff and nonsense about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald looked at her for some while. He was conscious
of a hushed great exultation that in a world
wherein all else seemed doubtful and unstable he had,
somehow, through blind luck, won to his Maya and
her snappishness and her unswerving and whole-hearted
and quite unscrupulous love for him. She was
not pretty, she was not brilliant, she was not even
easy to live with. But Gerald knew now that he and
this woman were one person; and that any living
without Maya would be a maimed business; and that
there could be nothing in Antan which could conceivably
content him for the loss of this dear, ever-wrangling,
dull-witted woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “But it is prophesied that the
power of Antan shall pass to the rider upon Kalki.
No harm can befall the rider upon Kalki. So we will
let—we will let our son take Kalki. For in this way
we will secure his protection, and we will remove the
one chance of my ever leaving you, who are worth
all the kingdoms that have ever been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maya said, “But—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald, smiling, replied, “Nevertheless!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the illusion called Theodorick Quentin Musgrave
was lifted up by Gerald to the back of Kalki,
and it was Gerald who adjusted the stirrups for his
successor upon the divine steed. And the seeming of
a child rode down toward the goal of all the gods,
a rather quaintly pathetic little figure perched up
there so high upon the back of the huge shining
stallion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald watched the two pass out of his sight. His
arms lifted after them ever so slightly. His arms
seemed to ache as he recalled the feel of that small
body and the warmth and yieldingness of it, which
were now lost forever. Theodorick Quentin Musgrave
was only an illusion contrived by forces which
it was not comfortable to think about. Gerald knew
that now with certainty. And it did not matter. Nor
did it cheer him to reflect—as he did,—that he was
in no worse case than all other fathers, no one of
whom might ever retain the child that was little and
helpless, and was loved for no reason at all, as nobody
could quite love the hobbledehoy thumping
schoolboy or even the estimable young man into
whom that warm and yielding, sturdy, so small body
might develop....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald turned to Maya. “I have only you.
But that which I have suffices me. I have been lucky,
O my dearest, very far beyond my merits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was regarding him with a sort of troubled
fondness; and her speech now was hardly snappish at
all. “You really are, my poor Gerald, quite too
ridiculous about the child! You talk, you actually do
talk, as though he were not ever coming back,—and
in good time for supper, too, unless he wants a spanking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that, Gerald raised a protesting hand. “Do
you not trick me into optimism, also! Too much ambition
and high dreams and that which was perhaps
divine have now departed forever. The illusion
which you created to be our son has departed, forever.
But use and wont and a great deal of honest
love remain. I do not say these things are heroic. I
do say that these suffice. So do you let the strong
bonds which are about me content you, my darling,
without wreathing them in the paper flowers of
optimism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are you, also,” Maya said, “content?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald answered: “I am well content. Day in,
day out, let there be between us faith, and aid, and a
great fondness, O my dear, and no parting! For
I am content and very contrite. I know that any life
without you would be a maimed business. I know that
I desire only to continue in our quiet way of living
upon Mispec Moor. For the middle way of life is
best. What need have I to be a god or to be seeking
unfamiliar places so that I may rule over them?
That way is troubled, and too full of noise and striving.
It is better to be content. It is better to be content
with the dear, common happenings of human
life, shared loyally with the one woman whose love
for you is limitless and does not change, for all that
it is blind to none of your failings; and to know that
these things are enough and very far beyond your
deserts; and not to be insanely hankering after any
more high-hearted manner of living which is out of
your reach or, at any rate, is attained through
more trouble than it is probably worth. Ah, yes, the
middle way of life is best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least it is some comfort,” Maya said, “to
hear you talking almost sensibly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she reached up, still with a grave and rather
tender smiling upon her beloved, homely face; and
she took away from Gerald’s eyes the rose-colored
spectacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact,” said a male voice, “the woman’s task
is ended.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch43'>43.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Economics of Redemption</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>F</span></span>OR now had come to them, traveling back
from Antan, the brown man. This brown man
came, he said, to summon Maya to her appointed
task of transforming yet other men into domestic
animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—For women,” he said, also, “have always
their fond task and their beneficent labor. Here, I
repeat, the woman’s task is ended. But yonder many
men go untamed and unbroken to the sane ways of
compromise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Maya a bit absent-mindedly assented, as she
put away those spectacles of hers for future use, that,
in point of fact, she supposed she had done everything
that was actually necessary in Gerald’s case,
although nobody ever would really know what a trial
he had been to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald for one instant looked at his wife. He
found in his wife’s face that which it is the doom of
most husbands to find there at one time or another.
And it caused Gerald to laugh a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless,” Gerald said, quietly, “I am
Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and the Preserver, the
Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones. I am Lord of the
Third Truth, in this world which knows of only two
truths and of the compromises which they beget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brown man greeted that with a thin smile.
“You have been long expected. Oh, very long have
scepticism and despair, with somewhat varying
voices, invoked your name, saying, ‘Who will overthrow
the Master Philologist!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and now,” said Gerald, with the outline
of a swagger, for he was getting himself more
in hand, “now that prophecy is about to be fulfilled,
for I am Hoo, and none other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, really, friend, I do not see how you can be
an interrogative pronoun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To a god, and more particularly to a Dirghic
god, all incarnations are possible. There is no reason
whatever why I should not be an interrogative pronoun.
It is merely a matter of divine election.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the brown man civilly inclined his grave brown
head, as he remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you have it your own way! Indeed, my people
have very often derived their deities from less
promising locations than the pages of a grammar.
And upon the whole, your epiphany is most gratifying.
For I try to keep my people content: yet it has
been lamented, from the beginning, that no mythology
revealed a god who might answer that word
which the Master Philologist speaks to all the gods
of men. And so, between despair and scepticism,
those of my people who were so unwise as to exercise
their minds in fields wherein thinking does not
make for happiness, have very long been saying,
‘Who will redeem the goal of all the gods of men
from the Master Philologist?’ Now it appears that
this word also has become flesh; and that this interrogative
pronoun Who? stands here before us. Yes,
I consider that quite gratifying; for it is desirable
that the sceptical and the despairing also should be
contented, by being justified in their faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You quibble,” Gerald replied, “you quibble very
tediously and frivolously, in the divine presence of a
god who is about to take over his appointed kingdom,
and to make known that Third Truth which is not
known upon Mispec Moor, where the one teaching is
that we copulate and die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But uncelestial common-sense has always been
my failing. So I must tell you, friend, that it seems to
me, now that you have abandoned the Redeemer’s
steed to a small freckled illusion, Antan has nothing
to expect even from the mysterious awfulness of an
interrogative pronoun. And yet, for one, I abandoned
the place when your dwarfed deputy approached
it—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you acted wisely, sir,” Gerald replied, with
simple dignity. “No matter how potent may be the
impious sorceries of the Master Philologist, a child
has entered into his domain, fearing nothing and
loving all. The fact that the powers of evil cannot
prevail against this conjunction is well known to
every citizen of the United States of America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the brown man still seemed rather moody. “I
cannot say.... No, you and my friend Jahveh have,
between you, loosed against Antan a power which is
not of my kingdom. I therefore do not pretend to say
what may come of the experiment. I merely await
with lively interest, and at a reassuring distance, the
upshot of this experiment, now that—of all the
beings from beyond Earth’s orbit,—Abdel-Hareth
has been deputed to ride upon the Redeemer’s steed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, in any case, it is always very certain,
dearie,” Maya said, “that no real comfort can ever
come of such foolish notions as I have ridded you of
a little by a little. And in exchange for those toplofty
dreams, I have trusted you as far as seemed expedient,
and I have given you all that was really good for
you. I have given you a season of content and every
wholesome joy of domesticity now for some thirty
years of mortal time. No man gets more from life,
my poor dearie. None attempts to get more without
ending in disappointment and discontent: and so no
sane man tries to get any more than you have had.
And the end finds even the most wise and reasonable
son of Adam—though, to be sure, that is not saying
much,—if he but lives rationally enough to survive
all thirty of those quiet happy years, with a wife who
is just as I am, whatever she may have seemed to
begin with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald saw, without any grief or horror, that he
had now lost both his child and his wife. For Maya
had become old. She was again the shrivelled and
wrinkled creature, red and inflamed and hideous
among her tousled tresses, that he had first found
upon Mispec Moor. And fleetingly he reflected that
she spoke the truth: all women, howsoever dear and
beautiful, did become like that, provided they did
not first die and become even more repulsive carrion....
But Gerald lacked time to discuss these generalities
just now: for he had been looking toward
Antan....</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To this chatter about domesticity and pessimism
and content,” Gerald replied sternly, “I answer that
the Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones is above all aphorisms.
I answer that I am Hoo, the Lord of that
Third Truth whose nature is unknown to you. Now
that Third Truth is loosed. Do you look now upon
Antan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman and the Adversary had turned when
Gerald pointed, quite as majestically as though he
knew just what he was talking about. In the midst of
Antan they could see, as Gerald had already seen, a
flaring green flame. Now this great flaming sunk
earthward, much as the waters of a fountain descend;
the flame spread evenly to every side, sweeping outward
in an ever-widening circle; and now this flaming
was no longer green, but red and glowing. You
saw this flood of fire pass equably and swiftly, surging
outward toward the horizon, where at once the
mountains collapsed and disappeared. All that remained
was flat and black and bare. Antan no longer
existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was from such a miracle that the woman and the
Adversary looked back toward Gerald, with every
sign of sincere respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald’s bewilderment was rather more profound
than theirs. He could surmise only that the
dreadful being to whom he had given Kalki had held
to its plan, as voiced by the lips of a child, and had
loosed elemental fires of a nature incomprehensible
to Gerald, since they were drawn from beyond
Earth’s orbit. Yet that seemed to Gerald no real reason
for marring a fine attitude or for failing to
preserve his self-respect before the woman and the
Adversary. Tricked he might have been: that was a
wholly different thing from ever admitting that he
had been tricked. Gerald knew at least that the illusion
which had appeared to be his son had entered
the perhaps equally illusory place where Gerald now
might never enter; and that, whatever had befallen
the best loved but one of his illusions, the rider
upon the silver stallion had destroyed Antan. And it
seemed obvious, too, that Abdel-Hareth had returned
homeward....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore Gerald claimed with a clear conscience
the miracle which Gerald had, in fact, actually performed,
at one remove. And Gerald kept his long
chin, resolutely, well up....</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that,” observed the brown man, quietly, “that
is the end of Antan. I do not complain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten,” then said the wrinkled old
woman who had been Maya of the Fair Breasts, “I
had forgotten how wilful is that Abdel-Hareth who
got his being upon Earth from me. Something of this
sort was to be looked for, the first moment that the
headstrong wretch was freed from my control. Still,
Jahveh has gained less than we have gained through
Jahveh’s meddling. Abdel-Hareth has served me
even at the last by removing Antan from the horizon.
Earth will be quieter now; and my daughters will not
be so hard put to it to keep men in reasonable order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forget nothing,” the brown man remarked,
drily. “And so I did not await the coming of your
first-born in the likeness of a child whose fearless
innocence surmounts all evil. For it was the seeming
of a little child who rode up against Antan, you conceive,
with every appearance of that faith against
which the snares of no sorcerer and of hardly nine
women in ten can prevail. Such innocence is a quite
dangerous counterfeit. For one, I do not meddle with
it nor with any other unearthly phenomenon. I have
my realm. It suffices me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman asked, “But what, what, Janicot, do
you suppose has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall we ever know, dear Havvah, when
manifestly there are no survivors of that happening?
Antan, in any case, is no loss to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Gerald broke in upon their talking; and Gerald
shook at them his red head lordlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little creatures guess in vain at the means
which I have employed. And equally in vain will you
supplicate me to reveal those means. For I shall tell
you nothing. It is sufficient that the Well-beloved of
Heavenly Ones has accomplished the mission of his
tenth incarnation with a thoroughness not customary
in interrogative pronouns. I came to redeem my appointed
kingdom from the rule of usurpers. I came as
the Lord of that Third Truth which is unknown to
those who teach only that we copulate and die. That
Third Truth has been loosed. No, I shall tell you
nothing of its nature, for you are not fit to comprehend
the Third Truth. But the mightiness of it
your own eyes have witnessed. So Antan is now redeemed—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice broke here. But Gerald presently continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Antan is now redeemed at a great price. That
woman and that child to whom my heart was given
have perished. I remain. I know that these two were
illusions. Nevertheless, I remain. There is no bond
upon the Lord of the Third Truth to be happy: there
is a strong bond upon every Helper and Preserver
not to evade the full discharge of his mission. What,
you may ask of me, is the mission of the Lord of the
Third Truth? And I will reply to you out of my
divine wisdom. It is the mission of the Lord of the
Third Truth, howsoever he may palter or struggle
against his doom, to destroy that which he most
loves.”</p>

heard a talking between the old woman who
had been his Maya and the brown man who
was the Adversary of all the gods of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it men desire?” said the woman. “My
daughters prepare for them fine food and drink, my
daughters see to it that their homes are snug, and at
the end of each day my daughters love them dutifully.
All things that men can ask for, my daughters
furnish them. Why need men cherish strange desires
which do not know their aims? for how can any of
my daughters content such desires?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I also marvel at the desires of men,” replied the
Adversary. “I, too, am ready to accord whatsoever
a man can ask for sensibly and in plain words. I,
who am the Prince of this world, remain a generous
and ever-indulgent monarch. I will to make my people
happy. My curious opulence awaits at every hand
to afford my subjects whatsoever they can ask. But
men want more. They desire that which was never
in my kingdom. They have followed after impalpable
gods: they have been enamored of phantoms. They
have believed that their desire was in Antan, in part
because they did not know what was their desire, and
in part because they did not know what was Antan.
Yes, it is well that Antan has perished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This world is well enough,” the woman said. “It
is well to be born into this world of an ever-loving
mother. It is well to be a young man in this world
wherein one may follow after young women and be
cherished by them. There is soft living in this world
when you have come as near discretion as men ever
get and have had the wit to find a wife to take care of
you. And at the end it is well to fare out of this world
quietly and incuriously, with a deft-handed woman
to nurse you and to wash your body afterward. But
men want more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This world is very good. My kingdom is a wholly
sufficing kingdom,” agreed the Adversary. “The wise
man, as goes human wisdom, will be content with
the inexhaustible goodness of those material things
which all are mine. For the five senses are an endless
comfort; the five senses are an endless store of
anodynes. A man may purchase bodily ease and a
drugged brain with his five senses. But men want
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they have passed beyond my daughters,” the
woman said. “One by one, a many have passed, perversely
and so lonely, from all my daughters could
contrive to content them: and one by one a host of
demented romantic men have struggled toward
Antan, and toward what befalls all mortals and immortals
there. Yes, it is very well that Antan has
perished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One by one,” said the Adversary, “they have
derided my kingdom. They have followed after impalpable
gods. These gods passed futilely. But they
drew many of my subjects from me, all to be lost forever
in that beguiling Antan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men are great fools, and my daughters can
hardly hamper their folly. That which my daughters
can do they perform willingly. But not all men could
my daughters preserve from the madness which drew
men toward Antan and into ruinous desires to judge
the goal of every god. At last, Antan has fallen: it is
very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Adversary said, more leniently: “Men are,
beyond doubt, great fools. But they are my people;
and those that I can save I save. Yet many evade me.
And their dreaming troubles all my realm and me,
too, they trouble now and then. But Antan has fallen:
and after that foolishness at least my people
will not be following any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The daughters of Eve are not troubled now and
then, they are troubled at every moment, by the
dreams of men. Such of these blundering men as fond
and eternal laboring may save, my daughters win
away from their toplofty dreams. But the work
is hard; the work is endless; and our losses are
many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the Adversary said: “We two who began
in the Garden to contrive for the happiness of
men, and to be speaking always for the real good of
men,—yes, certainly, our work is hard and endless.
For men stay romantically minded creatures who
aspire beyond my kingdom. Yet we do not despair.”</p>

on the naked moor, for the brown man
had departed, and Maya had gone away
with the first of all her lovers, and her illusions had
vanished, including the neat log and plaster cottage.
And mists were creeping up from the ruined kingdom
of Antan, in billows of ever-thickening gray which
seemed to be the smoke from that great burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come out of my native home on a gain-less
journeying with no profit in it: yet there has been
pleasure in that journeying. I do not complain. Let
every man that must journey, without ever knowing
why, from the dark womb of his mother to the dark
womb of his grave, take pattern by me!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all that every pleasure is departed from me,
I have had pleasure. I do not grieve because I have
gained nothing in my journeying. The great and
best words of the Master Philologist stay unrevealed;
that supreme word which was in the beginning,
and which will be when all else has perished,
I may not surmise: but I have played with many
words which were rather pretty. In the art of magic
which I chose to be my art I have performed no
earth-shaking wonders, yet in small thaumaturgies
I have had some hand. I did not ride the divine
steed to my journey’s end: but a part of the way I
rode quite royally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That which I heard of from afar I have not
won to in my foiled journeying. So I now cry farewell
to that Queen Freydis whom, I suspect, I might
have loved with a great love if lesser women had
not solicited me. I cry farewell to the Mirror of the
Hidden Children in which, I believe, I might have
found myself as I am, and might have come to
knowledge of the Third Truth. And I cry farewell
to Antan, to that never-won-to goal of all the gods
which was, I think, my appointed kingdom. I have
surmised high things. I have gained none of them.
My doom has been a little doom. It contents me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may well be content, because all that a man
may hope for I have had, who have learned at least
that the lot of a man is more sure than the lot of
any god. For the deceit which you put upon me, O
venerable and subtle Æsred, I cry out my gratitude.
There was the seeming of a home and of a woman
who loved and tended me and of a child. I may not
speak of my love for these illusions. Now they have
perished. But my memories remain: and they are
more dear to me than is any real thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All, all, is perished! It may be that I have
offended the two truths which I did not esteem sufficiently
august. And I who willed to be Lord of
the Third Truth have found no third truth anywhere.
I have found only comfortably colored illusions.
But I am content with that which I have found
here upon Mispec Moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the while that Gerald had been speaking, the
mists rose thicker and thicker from destroyed Antan.
He had noted in the while that he spoke how
the first wavering thin billows crept tentatively up
the hills and along the roadway, creeping upon the
ground, and under the low-swinging tree branches,
with, as it seemed, a pre-meditated furtiveness; and
then, as if emboldened by finding the way unopposed,
these mists had risen up from the ground, always
swiftlier, until now they had eclipsed all. Gerald,
now that he ended his talking, could see nothing
palpable anywhere save the little patch of intermingled
stone and grass immediately beneath his
feet; and about him everywhere were the cool mists,
lighted with a diffused gray radiancy which seemed
to come from all sides.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>G</span></span>ERALD now was wandering among thick
luminous gray mists, on a gray way which
led through long quieted places. It led him
to a weather-beaten pavilion of badly stained and
tattered cloth which once had been flesh-colored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within this pavilion was a masked skeleton. The
gleaming bones sat upright, and in unmarred order,
in a gilded chair. A fan lay in the lap of this skeleton,
a fan that was painted with the gay amours of
Harlequin and Columbine, which Pierrot was observing,
wistfully, through a gap in a yew-hedge:
and the skeleton wore a little black velvet carnival
mask, which covered all the upper front part of the
skull, about the eye-sockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beyond that was a castle, whose exterior was
overlaid with cracked and peeling black-and-gold
lacquer work. This castle was empty everywhere of
any inhabitant. Gerald passed through its courtyard
and about many large rooms and corridors, all hung
with faded, very ancient tapestries. He encountered
nobody. Then he came to the inmost tower, builded
of horn, and so into the room which had been the
bedchamber of the lord of that castle, and he perceived
the reason why not even mice nor spiders
dared to dwell in that place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterward Gerald came to a dragon’s den. But
the dragon was dead long ago, and the cupboards
of that den were as empty as had been the castle of
Vraidex, except for a pepper cruet and a salt cruet,
both of time-blackened silver, and a light golden
semi-circular crown inset with emeralds such as
blonde princesses were used to wear in that dragon’s
heyday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thence Gerald passed to a jousting ground, and
that too was tenantless and fallen into decay. In
the paved place where knights had tilted against one
another lay at random nineteen broken spears and
three tarnished shields. In the ladies’ gallery Gerald
found only a chamber pot. The hangings of this
gallery were discolored and torn, but you could yet
see that these hangings had been of black cloth embroidered
with small rearing silver horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald came also to a green pasture through
which flowed unruffled a deep stream of still water.
This pasture was strewn everywhere with many
curious objects. He noted a crozier, and a wheel,
and a camel-hair shirt, and a huge gridiron, and a
copper dish containing the breasts of a young
woman. He found in that pasture also a porcelain
box of ointment, and a great saw, and a blue hat,
and a large iron comb, which like the saw had long-dried
blood upon its teeth, and a palm branch, and
two enormous, very rusty keys marked with the
monogram S. P.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald passed where three crosses lay overturned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beyond that the way was yet more murky.
To this hand and the other hand Gerald could just
dimly divine the ruined porticos and domes and
pylons of incredibly ancient buildings: he seemed to
go among obelisks and many-storied square towers.
But all was very gray and dubious. He wandered
now in a cloudiness wherein not anything was indisputable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed across a narrow bridge beneath which
showed a dark and sluggish river. In that water
Gerald could see moving, many-colored figures which
were not strange to him. For Evasherah was there,
and Evaine, and Evarvan, and Evadne also, smiling
at him now for the last time, and he could see how
notably they had all resembled one another. And
yet one more woman was there, a blue-clad woman
in a crown just such as Maya had worn before she
became his wife, but the face of this woman Gerald
could not clearly discern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And upon the farther bank of the dark river one
sat among a herd of black swine, and the eyes of all
these swine gleamed meditatively at Gerald through
their ragged white lashes. The man arose: and Gerald
saw this swine-driver was that same young red-haired
Horvendile who was Lord of the Marches
of Antan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Horvendile began to speak.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch47'>47.<br> <span class='sub-head'>How Horvendile Gave Up the Race</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>H</span></span>ORVENDILE spoke of the race of Manuel,
and of the joy, and the vexation, too,
which the antics of this so inadequate race
had been to Horvendile. And it was of Merlin that
Gerald was thinking now, for it seemed to him that
here was yet another poet who did not any longer delight
to shape and to play with puppets, because Horvendile
was saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I abandon a race whose needs are insatiable.
For tall Manuel lived always wanting what he
had not ever found, and never, quite, knowing what
thing it was which he wanted, and without which
he might not ever be contented. And Jurgen also,
after Heaven’s very best had been done to grant
him what he sought for, could reply only that he
was Jurgen who sought he knew not what. And all
their descendants have been like these maddening
two in this at least, all seeking after they could not
say what. Nobody can do anything for such a race!
For their needs have stayed insatiable: their journeying
has been, in every land and in every time, a foiled
journeying: and in the end, in the inevitable unvarying
end, each one of you treads that gray quiet way
of ruins which leads hither and to no other place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, for that matter,” Gerald said, “it seems
that you too, Horvendile, have some engagement in
this hog wallow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I endeavor, in point of fact, to become familiar
with this last stretch of limbo, against the time of
my own possible need not ever to be remembered
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And for my part, I came of my own choice
and in self-protection,” Gerald continued, with his
chin well up. “For I must tell you, Horvendile, that
I have had little peace since our last meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald (putting out of mind those attendant,
very hungry looking pigs) related the epic of
his journeying, without reserving anything out of
false modesty, now that he talked with a confrère.
He told of how he had descended into the underwater
palace of the Princess Evasherah and of the
orgies which he had shared in. He spoke, a bit contritely,
of the amorous excesses he had been led into
by the wives and the three hundred and fifty-odd
concubines of Glaum during their master’s absence.
With unconcealed embarrassment he told of how
the people of Lytreia had endeavored to detain
him in their temple, to reign there as their tribal
god, because they found his nose to be so much more
majestic than the idol they hitherto had worshipped.
He confessed to his dalliance with the enamored
Fox-Spirit. He frankly admitted that he had not behaved
well in seducing Evarvan and then deserting
her after her marvelous beauty had become to him
an old story. He told of how Queen Freydis had
come repeatedly to him with the most generous proffers
of her realm and person; and he spoke of this
matter with visible compunction, because he could
not deny that after three or four bouts he had repulsed
the infatuated poor lady rather rudely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fine, said Gerald, since every man ought
honestly to acknowledge his own weaknesses, he
could get no real peace in the Marches of Antan.
So at the last he had stolen away, into this quiet,
gray untroubled place, of his own accord, just to be
rid of so many persons who took unfair advantage
of his over-amiable and fiery nature....</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Horvendile, at the end of Gerald’s repentant
narrative, observed: “I comprehend. You have
been, in brief, the devil of a fellow and a sad rip
among the ladies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you wrong me! Such a suspicion is
very horrifying and quite unjust! No, it is merely
that not even Fair-haired Hoo, the Helper and
Preserver, the Lord of the Third Truth, and the
Well-beloved of Heavenly Ones, is immune to over-constant
temptation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And at that, Horvendile shrugged. “A god with
so many fine titles is not to be argued with. In any
case, do you be of good cheer, for even after all
these regrettable amours, and beyond the mire that
my swine delight in, the Princess still awaits you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in what place?” said Gerald, “and how is
she called?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She awaits in every place so long as youth remains—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word, now, Horvendile, but that is the
truth, and a rather plaguing truth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—However, this especial Princess is called, as
it chances, Evangeline—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come!” said Gerald, “come now, but
really, my dear fellow—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—And at your first sight of her you will be enraptured.
For this Princess Evangeline is so surpassingly
lovely that she excels all the other women
your gaze has ever beheld—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Gerald. “Her face is the proper
shape, it is appropriately colored everywhere, and
it is surmounted with an adequate quantity of hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Nor,” Horvendile went on, with rising enthusiasm,
“is it possible to find any defect in her
features—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: for, doubtless, the colors of this beautiful
young girl’s two eyes are nicely matched, and her
nose stands just equidistant between them. Beneath
this is her mouth; and she has also a pair of ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fine,” said Horvendile, with his hands
aflourish above his attendant pigs, “the Princess is
young, she exhibits no absolute deformity anywhere,
and your enamored glance will therefore perceive
in her no fault, because of that magic which in the
Marches of Antan the Two Truths exercise over all
vigorous young persons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You very movingly depict a woman of extraordinary
and, I have not the least doubt, resistless
charm. Nevertheless, I cannot any longer be wandering
about a place wherein there are only two truths,
and where the magic of these Two Truths is forever
meddling with my young body, for the gods of the
Marches of Antan do not content me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Horvendile replied: “Men have found
many gods. But these gods pass. They descend into
Antan, and they do not return. One god and one
goddess alone do not pass. They remain eternally,
if but to weave eternally a mist about the seeing and
the thinking of the young, and thus to secure the existence
of yet other young persons within a month
or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With observations to that same general effect,”
Gerald answered, “I am not unfamiliar. But let us
make the thing complete! Do you now voice, here in
your murky pigsty, one or another long-winded
restatement of the fact that time disastrously affects
all organic material. You will then, I think, have
summed up the entire philosophy of the Marches of
Antan. Perhaps it is a true philosophy. Nevertheless,
that philosophy is a morbid materialism such as does
not amuse me, who am a self-respecting citizen of
the United States of America. No: I had far rather
play with a beautiful idea than with one utterly
lacking in seductiveness. So I prefer to think that
the gods and the dreams of men pass to a noble and
a worthy goal—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Horvendile sighed, a bit despondently.
“Ah, Gerald, but how may you presume to
speak of such matters, who did not attain to
Antan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” replied Gerald, affably, “I was
too wise to risk any such indiscretion. No: I did not
enter into my appointed kingdom; and I have destroyed
it. Therefore it must remain, so long as I
remain, whatever I choose to imagine it. I retain
the privilege of playing with a beautiful idea, in just
the proper half-remorseful frame of mind which
begets the most luxuriant fancies—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—” Horvendile began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear fellow, you are quite wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horvendile said, “Still—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there is something in that, at first glance,
yet it does not really touch the root of the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horvendile protested, “I was but going to
say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know! I perfectly comprehend your argument.
And I admit that you phrase it forcefully. The
trouble is that you are wrong in your underlying
principle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horvendile said, “However—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not always,” Gerald stated. “For the
one way for a poet to appreciate the true loveliness
of a place is not ever to go to it. No, Horvendile, a
poet is not to be fobbed off with facts. No matter
what the surrounding facts might be, all poets from
Prometheus to Jurgen have preferred a beautiful
idea to play with. So a logical poet will always destroy
his appointed kingdom, because in this way
only can he convert it into a beautiful idea. Therefore
for me, who am a poet of sorts, to have entered
into my appointed kingdom would have been woefully
shiftless. I would have had henceforward only
one kingdom. But, as it is, I can remake the destroyed
place several times a day, in my imaginings,
and can every time rebuild it more beautifully. I have
thus a thousand kingdoms, each one of them more
lovely than the other. To-day it will be Evasherah
who awaits me there, among all the splendor and the
perfume and the sunlit lewdness of the most ancient
East: to-morrow the sweet singing of feathery-legged
Evadne will summon me to a quite different
Antan, which then will be a sea-engirdled, low-lying
tropic island: but the day after that, far more idyllic
lures will be recalling me to that pastel-colored,
pastoral and rather populous Antan which is inhabited
by all the many dreams that I had in youth,
and is to be made my strictly personal heaven by
the pure lips of Evarvan. Whereas, upon yet other
occasions,—when my turn of mind takes on a more
scholastic turn,—I shall know that in Antan awaits
me each paragraph of the profound, wide erudition
of Evaine.... But more often, Horvendile, I shall
think of yet another woman and of a boy child, who
were not wonderful in anything, but who for a while
seemed mine. And I shall believe that these two
wait for me, in a much more prosaic Antan; and I
shall know that no magic, howsoever mightier than
the less aspiring dreams of my manhood, can afford
to me anything more dear.... For all that one
needs, Horvendile, I have had. Antan could boast
of nothing more desirable, to me, than that which
I have had. So now not any power can ever quell my
thankfulness for those illusions which have made
sport with me for my allotted while. And I cry out
defiantly, among your waiting swine, in this gray
place of endless ruining, I am content...!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Horvendile replied: “A fool with so many
fine words at his tongue’s tip, a fool also is not to
be argued with. For it is a foolishness beyond any
describing, to believe that Antan can be destroyed
by you or by anybody else. Ah, no! your kingdom
awaited you, poor Gerald: but you faltered, you fell
away into domesticity,—and you talked! Now it
is the Master Philologist who, through the might
of that word which was in the beginning, and which
will be when all else has perished, has removed your
kingdom from your reach, and from your seeing, and
even from your quite whole-hearted belief, forever.
Now it is your only comfort to poultice your failure
with such foolish phrases. And now also it is I who
tell you that for such faltering and for such failure,
and for such phrases, there is possible but one answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter Horvendile gave Gerald a queer word
of power, and Horvendile took out of his pocket a
little mirror three inches square. You heard in the
duskiness a flapping of small vigorous wings. Then
three white pigeons stood among the swine, at the
feet of Horvendile. He did what was requisite: and
Gerald thus came straightway into a place which
was not unfamiliar.</p>

no more than four months ago, as it appeared
to him, he had quitted his natural
body. Lights burned there, but the room was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did he perceive any marked signs of change.
Most of his books were very much as he had left
them. Upon the bookcases were still ranged his
porcelain and brass animals and birds and reptiles.
Investigation, though, revealed the addition to this
diminutive fauna of a rather charming china cat,—a
black cat, fast asleep, with a red ribbon about its
neck,—and of a small ivory elephant, which also
was black, but had white tusks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chairs, he saw, had been recovered, but it
was with a figured stuff of much the same design
and color. The rug that once had been his
mother’s was still underfoot; and the curtains,
while new looking, were of just the same repulsive
shade of green velvet that by candle light turned
yellowish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a quite detestable color. I had always intended
to change those curtains so soon as I could
afford it, for a green with some real life in it. I can
but deduce that my body has remained remarkably
conservative through all these thirty years which
have seemed to me only a month or two. My body
has evinced commendable industry, also, for here
are dozens upon dozens of books by Gerald Musgrave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a bit droll thus to be confronted with
so much strange work performed by his own natural
body,—thought out in his own brain cells, and
written with his own hand,—during the time that
these chattels had been entrusted to the Sylan. Yet
the results were gratifying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For here were not any folderol romances such as
Gerald himself, he felt uneasily, might have perhaps
contrived with those brain cells and that hand,
romances which at best would have wasted his
readers’ time, and at worst might have incited unedifying
and improper notions. Instead, these
quartos were all serious and learned and scholastic
works. Gerald therefore regarded these large quartos
with a justifiable pride and with profound respect.
Their very bindings were in themselves as
incompatible with anything frivolous as were their
contents with any unscientific double meanings.
These books had the fine clarity of a physician in
conference with a midwife. Moreover, Gerald’s admiring
eyes found nearly every page empedestalled
upon the most impressive looking kind of footnotes:
upon tall footnotes in almost illegibly small type;
upon huge polyglottic footnotes very full of numerals
and brackets, which flatteringly assumed
your acquaintance with all human tongues and your
possession of all printed books, so that you could be
referred offhand to such and such a page of an
especial edition; and upon footnotes which appeared
to quote from the literature of every known language
after having abbreviated the title of each cited
volume into unintelligibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For these quartos dealt with no romantic nonsense
such as the phantasms with which novels vitiate the
intelligence and the morals of their readers, Gerald
observed, but with really worth-while ethnographic
matters like the marriage customs of all lands, and
the ways of male and female prostitution among the
different races, and with the history in each country
of paederasty, and of lesbianism, and of bestiality,
and of necrophily, and of incest, and of sodomy, and
of onanism, and of all manifestations of the sexual
impulse in every era. There, in a more imaginative
vein, were the <span class='it'>Tentative Restoration of the Lost
Books of Elephantis</span>, the handsomely illustrated
<span class='it'>Seed of Minos</span>, the doctoral thesis upon <span class='it'>Lingham
Worship</span>, the <span class='it'>Fertility Rites of the Sabbat</span>, the privately
published <span class='it'>Myth of Anistar and Calmoora</span>, the
<span class='it'>Study of Priapos</span>, and the various other monumental
works which, although Gerald did not know this,
had already made Gerald Musgrave’s name familiar
to the lecture halls of all universities and the pages
of the more learned reviews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These quartos were, in fine, the books which had
made Gerald Musgrave the most famous and widely
read of American ethnologists; and by his body’s
industry and erudition and broad-mindedness Gerald
was properly impressed. Here seemed, indeed,
to be at least one complete and scholarly treatise
devoted to the historical development and the mechanics
and the literature of every known manifestation
of the great forces which had created all life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is really edifying to note with what zeal
and common-sense my body—while I was a-gypsying
with over-ambitious follies,—has decorously
set up as the recorder of historical and scientific
truths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald found upon the next shelf some
fourteen tall scrapbooks. They were full of what
the newspapers had printed in laudation and in the
most respectful criticism of the books of Gerald
Musgrave. They contained, also, accounts of the
academic honors conferred upon Gerald Musgrave.
They were interleaved with the letters which had
been written—the majority, of course, by that
strange race which writes habitually to authors, but
many of them, apparently, by persons of some consequence,—to
Gerald Musgrave about his books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My body in my absence has become, thanks to
my body’s books, a reputable and even a looked-up-to
citizen. My body is by way of being, indeed, a
personage. I note, too, with that interest appropriate
to the foibles of the great, that my body has also
become a somewhat vain old magpie, gathering up
through thirty years every scrap of paper which
happens to display my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next Gerald lighted on a black box with silver
corners, and inside it was a time-discolored manuscript.
This Gerald carried to the writing-table. And
he found it that unfinished romance about his heroic
ancestor, Dom Manuel of Poictesme, just ninety-three
pages of it, precisely as Gerald had left it, with
no word changed or added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was not in my natural body sufficient
power to sustain the high inspiration of my youth.
So, very sensibly, my body has found other pursuits,
and through them it has become a personage. I do
not complain. Not every body becomes a personage.
Even so, it seems a pity to have denied to mankind
the loveliness already created in this fragment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was just then that the door opened. In the
doorway stood a man in late middle life. And Gerald
now for one instant regarded his natural body
and all the dilapidations which time had performed
upon that body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald somehow comprehended the penned-in
and eventless and self-sacrificing, arduous life of
the famous scholar, the life which had been lived
so long by the natural body of Gerald Musgrave.
That blinking magpie, in this somewhat stuffy room,—in
the midst of this childish menagerie of small
cats and elephants and dogs and parrots and chickens
and camels and other imbecile toys,—day after
day compiled the valuable and interesting matter in
those quartos and the trivial magniloquence in those
scrapbooks. And that, virtually, was all he ever did.
Such was his living in a world profuse in so many
agreeabilities,—to be tasted and seen, to be smelt
and heard and handled, at absolutely your own discretion,
in this so opulent world wherein anyone
could live very royally, and with never-failing ardor,
upon every person’s patrimony of the five human
senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, such self-devotion had paid, under
time’s grasping governance, an exorbitant tax. The
impaired shrunk body was unhealthy looking. Under
each of the wavering dim eyes showed a peculiar
white splotch. The skin of the noted scholar was
pasty and seemed greasy. He had hardly any hair
except those gray and untended whiskers. Everywhere
he was shrivelled and lean, except for the
abrupt, the surprising, protrusion of a large paunch.
He self-evidently had inadequate kidneys, and an
impaired heart, and defective teeth, and a sluggish
liver, and approximately every other drawback to
a sedentary person’s late middle life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body of this ornament to scholarship and
letters was, in fine, a quite disgusting bit of wreckage,
in need of patching up everywhere; and a fallen
god, when thus confronted by the work of time and
of much study and of intramural living, might very
well shake his red ever-busy head over the one refuge
now remaining to down-tumbled divinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, Gerald spoke the queer word of
power which Horvendile had given him. There followed
for Gerald an instant of dizziness, of a moment’s
blindness....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald found that it was he who stood at
the door of the library peering into the quiet lamp-lit
room. Before him waited a red-headed, slim
young man in a blue coat and a golden yellow waistcoat,
with a tall white stock and very handsome
ruffles about his throat. And the young fellow was
smiling at Gerald Musgrave with a rather womanish
mouth, and in the eyes of the boy was a half-lazy,
mildly humorous mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Gerald Musgrave adored him with an ardor
which was half hatred. Then he saw that the young
fellow did not matter, and that Gerald Musgrave
had bargained well.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch49'>49.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Triumph of the Two Truths</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>“T</span></span>HAT is a strange and glorious word for
you to be telling me,” the boy began. “That
is a disastrous bargain for you to be seeking.
For your own will has spoken the revealing word
which buys back your natural body now that your
outworn crumbling body is of no more worth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald answered: “I, who have left the Marches
of Antan forever, have bought freedom from the
ever-meddling magic of the Two Truths. At my
first sight of no other female body which is not positively
deformed will I become enraptured. I have
bought feet too old for errancy, ears that are deaf
to the high gods, and to the heart-stirring music of
great myths, and to the soft wheedling of women
also, and I have bought eyes too dim to note whether
or not Antan still gleams on the horizon. It is a good
bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he took up again the pages of that thirty-year-old
romance. That too remains, he reflected,
unfinished, like all else which I have ever undertaken....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some day it will be completed by other hands
than the thin wrinkled hands before me. Somebody
else,—not born, as yet, it may be,—will be writing
out,—intelligibly, anyhow,—the story of Poictesme
and of the Redeemer of Poictesme and of his
fine followers and many children,—but not half
so splendidly as I was going to write it. Somebody
else will, by and by, be beleaguering and entering
into—by means of the little, yet the not wholly
despicable, art of letters,—that wonder-haunted
province which—yes, that also,—was a part of
my appointed kingdom.... Somebody else will be
laying open the fair ways to Bellegarde and to
Amneran and to Storisende, and will be making free
these ways to every person, so that, through the
lean lesser art of letters, Poictesme may become in
some sort another Antan,—an Antan perhaps considerably
abated in splendor, but graced at least with
easy accessibility....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet not even such slight triumphs were to be won
by aged feet, and by ears no longer acute, and by
dimming eyes, and by pulses which would not be
riotous ever any more. He tore up the pages one by
one, just as, he recollected now, in the land of Lytreia,
Evaine had torn up the sacred fig-leaves.
Glaum had said that the fig-leaf was the true symbol
of romance. Gerald meditatively dropped the destroyed
fragments of his romance into the waste-basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerald spoke then without any too great hopefulness.
“Has my body, during your inhabitancy of
it, my dear fellow, escaped from Evelyn Townsend?
and gone free from the unmerited blessing of a good
woman’s love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red-headed boy before him replied, discreetly:
“Your body and the body of your Cousin
Evelyn have always been such good friends!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald smiled. “I recognize that phrase. So
throughout thirty years Lichfield has never once
forgotten its polite formula for exorcising the inadmissible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been generally felt,” the youngster answered,
“that a prominent man of letters was entitled
to his Egeria. Of recent years, to be sure, your
friendship has not been—we will say,—so ardent
nor so frequently manifested. But there has been,
to hold you two together, the boy begotten by your
body upon her body. There has been the long usage
to hold you two together. So your friendship has remained
unshattered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had forgotten,” Gerald said, “the boy. Yes,
I remember hearing that you had thoughtfully provided
me with offspring during my absence. I know
not quite how to thank you, my dear fellow, for a
favor so delicate and so personal. We will therefore
cough and drop the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald leaned back in the chair. He put
together his finger-tips, and smilingly he looked at
them with rather tired, old eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I stay faithful to one woman, after all! I
have been kept in everything a model American citizen.
I have gracefully adhered to the code of a
gentleman. In my private life I have evinced every
proper respect for the chivalrous sacrament of
adultery between social equals. In the field of my
professional labors I have composed no puerile and
lascivious romances, but only serious and instructive
works. I am, in brief, in all respects, a credit to my
native Lichfield, and, more generally, to the United
States of America.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shrugged. He spread out those old-looking,
futile hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, certainly I must not spoil the miracle. So
I submit. I yield to the demands of propriety. I accept
my personal good behavior; I accept my
success; and I accept also my measure of actual
famousness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Gerald said: “Therefore I must, so long
as my life lasts, continue faithfully your work as
the recorder of historical and scientific truths, since
it was such truths which brought my name into
famousness. Oh, yes, you may depend upon it, I
shall henceforward honor these fine truths within
the limits advisable for anybody now nearing sixty.
I shall serve them, that is, with my pen rather than
with other instruments now perhaps more fallible.
For the trained intelligence of such a famous scholar
as I have become cannot deny their proper importance
to those scientific and historical truths which
brought him into famousness,—nor would, of
course, my admirers care to have me abandoning my
métier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Gerald said also: “Even in the private relations
which you have chivalrously preserved for me,
my dear fellow, one must not ask everything. Wheresoever
a man lives, there will be a thornbush near
his door: and I can manage well enough, I daresay,
to put up with the continuance of this illicit love-affair,—in
which, after all, my advanced age now
protects me from being put to any frequent or far-reaching
inconvenience. Meanwhile, the legend of a
life-long illicit love-affair is a very splendid preservative
for the fame of any writer. It would have
been even better, of course, if in conjugating the
verb to love, you had managed to make a few mistakes
in gender; that is more piquant; that is infallible:
still, I repeat, one must not ask everything. I
have my satisfying legend of private immorality,
created without any least trouble on my part. Men
will remember it. So all ends very well indeed. I am
content with what I have found upon Mispec Moor.
I am content with what I have found in Lichfield.
And I shall not bother any more about Antan,
wherein, for one reason and another, I have found
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not be speaking lightly of Antan! For
I—do you not understand?”—the young man
spoke with an almost frightened elation,—“it is I
who am called to reign in Antan. You have brought
me the revealing word and the dreadful summons of
Horvendile. Antan is my appointed kingdom, into
which I shall now be entering upon the silver stallion
famous in old prophecies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh!” said Gerald, “so that is how it is! All
ends, again, with that rather hackneyed scoring <span class='it'>Da
capo</span>. And the eternal quest of Antan continues, for
all that I have no part in it....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the boy’s joyousness and proud faith appeared
to old Gerald Musgrave pitiable beyond thought.
Gerald, now that he was fifty-eight, was of course
not really troubled by that pitiableness, because all
actual commiseration and sympathy for other persons
had withered in him along with the rest of
youth’s over-upsetting emotions. Besides, Gerald saw
that, in logic, as a plain question of arithmetic, the
boy did not matter. A million or so other lads more
or less like this enthusiastic young fellow were at
that instant preparing for the same downcasting and
failure; and by and by these lads also would be facing
their own unimportance with equanimity. For,
as you—howsoever suddenly,—got older, there
was less bitterness, there was hardly any bitterness
at all, to be derived of the knowledge that in human
living very much amounted to nothing, because you
saw even more clearly and more constantly that nothing
amounted to very much....</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Gerald said only: “You are young. At least,
you are living in a young body. So do you beware!
For, so long as you go about the Marches of Antan
in any conveyance so perilous, the lying half-magic of
the Two Truths will beset that young body, and the
Princess will await you at every turn. She will encounter
you under many names, for it is true that,
just as you said very long ago, women do vary in
their given names. She will encounter you in varying
shapes. But in any case, she waits for every young
romantic everywhere, as a rather lovable and as an
interestingly formed and colored impediment....
I think it, therefore, highly improbable that you will
complete the journey to Antan. I, in any case, am
middle-aged. And I cry, not discontentedly, my personal
farewell to the half-magic of racing pulses and
of distended nerves—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant Gerald was silent. In his old eyes
awoke that gleam which anybody familiar with Gerald
would have recognized at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he continued, with large affability,
“while you have been theorizing, my dear fellow,—oh,
very charmingly, and with a thoroughness which
does you credit, great credit,—well, my investigations
meanwhile have taken a rather more practical
turn. I am not, of course, at liberty to speak of my
love-affairs out yonder, with any real explicitness.
No, here, as always, <span class='it'>noblesse oblige</span>. Still, if you only
knew! If you but knew half as much as I do about
that droll escapade with the Lady Sigid of Audierne
and her cousin the Abbess! about what happened to
me in the harem of Caliph Mizraim! about Beatrice
and Henriette and Madame Pamela and Vittoria
and Elspeth! about the three girls at the tanner’s! or
if you knew the truth as to what her Majesty and
I were about that night we came so near being
caught—!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” the boy said, rather wistfully. “You have
been a devil of a fellow and a sad rip among the
ladies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear me, not at all!” said Gerald. And the
old fellow now wore the expression which, sometimes,
accompanies a blush. “It is merely that I have
talked a bit too freely. It is only that this rash tongue
of mine was running away with me. So I can but ask
you to forget every word I have uttered. For exalted
names ought, really, not to be repeated thus lightly.
I shall therefore say nothing whatever about the
eight other queens with whom my name has been
coupled,—with how good reason I, you understand,
must be the last person in the world to admit,—nor
about any of the empresses either. In fact, a great
deal of the scandal about my intimacy with one of
them was exaggerated. No: I most certainly must
not voice any indiscretions about dear Caroline. So I
merely point out—without mentioning any names
whatever,—that my experience has been considerable:
and I can assure you, my dear fellow, that in
the end these half-magics produce, after all, no very
prodigious miracles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—” said the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Gerald protested, “no, really, you must
not tempt me with such eloquence! It suffices that
during the thirty years that you have sat here theorizing,—and
have, as it were, blossomed forth with all
these delightful books,—these half-magics have led
me day after day from one affair to its twin; they
have led me into more or less jealously guarded lowlands,
which were not markedly dissimilar; they have
led then from one valley to another valley which
looked and felt and, for that matter, smelt very much
the same; finally they led me to the fair breasts of
Maya. And I fell away into domesticity, I went no
farther. But I was wholly content there.... So I
do not complain. I have lost through these half-magics
my appointed kingdom in Antan,—or so, at
least, it appears to me, in a world wherein perhaps
nothing is indisputable except, of course, historical
and scientific truths. Yet the losing of my kingdom
has, none the less, been pleasant. I have had, under
the harryings of these half-magics—always, I mean,
upon the whole,—an agreeable time. To-night the
half-magics whose appointed duty it is to keep all
us romantics from attaining to Antan have ceased
bothering about me. After to-night I am no longer
formidable. I am, in a word, now that I approach
sixty, almost middle-aged. It follows that Antan does
not concern me any longer: and I shall think no more
about Antan, wherein, for one reason and another, I
have found nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that, gray Gerald Musgrave dipped his pen.
He put the boy quite out of mind. And the well-thought-of
old scholar began to write, just where his
natural body had left off a bit earlier in the evening,
setting down decorously the historical and scientific
truth as to the rules governing pre-nuptial intercourse
in the bedchambers of New Guinea and the Tonga
Islands.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch50'>50.<br> <span class='sub-head'>Exodus of Glaum</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'><span style='font-size:larger'>T</span></span>HE boy waited, looking down at this old
fellow who sat there making small scratches
upon paper, the most of which he presently
canceled with yet other scratches, all the while with
the air of a person who is about something intelligent
and of actual importance. Then the boy shrugged.
For, as always, to an onlooker the motions of creative
writing revealed that flavor of the grotesque
which is attendant upon every form of procreation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And besides, to him for whom the silver stallion
waited without, and for whom his appointed kingdom
waited also, such time-wasting appeared futile.
He, who was young, and who retained as yet the untroubled
faith of every boy in his own abilities and
in his own importance,—and who, of course, might
not foresee the fate which awaited him in the arms
of Evadne of the Dusk,—could not regard without
impatience such time-wasting. What made it even
worse was that this dilapidated remnant of a man
was so plainly enjoying himself. For he chuckled as
he wrote; he had self-evidently found what he considered
a rather beautiful idea to play with, for now
he had cocked his battered, so nearly bald, old head
to one side, and that which he had just written down
was being regarded by his dimmed and peering eyes
with entire admiration: and it was all somewhat
pitiable to the young eyes of the observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For it did not seem possible that anybody should
sit here, thus stuffily immured, and with no exercise
more profitable than writing, when yonder, as all
youth knew, the way lay open to the unimaginable
splendors of Antan. It was, for that matter, an unthrifty
wantonness for Gerald Musgrave’s young observer
to be lingering here, in the cold company of
books and china animals, when yonder (as all youth
knew) along the pleasant way to Antan were waiting
so many dear, fond, loving women eager to cheer
and to inspire and to trust and to give all to speed
the high-hearted adventurer in that glorious journeying
toward his appointed kingdom. Decidedly,
the old fellow was lost: for now he was infatuated
by the contentment to be got out of writing, which
remained always, in its own way, as bedrugging as
the contentment to be got out of domesticity; and
there was no help for this preposterous, doomed,
chuckling Gerald Musgrave,—who would always
now be finding one or another rather beautiful idea
to play with, and who must remain, so long as life
remained, a poet whose one real delight was to shape
and to play with puppets....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet it mattered very little, to any person who
was already for every practical purpose a reigning
monarch, that all which pertained to this Gerald
Musgrave was somewhat droll, the smiling red-haired
boy decided, as he passed toward Evadne of
the Dusk, and out of sight of that gray-fringed bald
head bent over that incessant pen scratching.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
